2 "The case number of the subsequent complaint filed against the defendant was not even made part of the record during the Superior Court hearing."
2 "Dated this 26th day of October, 1979."
2 "Appellant was charged with the misdemeanor offense of presenting an obscene performance by parting her vulva with her hands while lying down on stage in violation of Â§28.50 of the Guam Criminal and Correctional Code [9 GCA]."
2 "The following facts were adduced at trial:"
2 "On or about February 10, 1978, at approximately 1:05 p.m., a Mr. Duran of the Department of Public Safety Vice Division had gone with an Officer SabÃ­an to the Sandy You Club in Tamuning."
2 "After entering the club, Duran and SabÃ­an sat at a table which was located approximately ten to fifteen feet in"
2 "Duran attempted to photograph appellant's performance."
2 "He was prevented from doing so by one of the club's waitresses, who informed him that taking pictures in the club was not permitted."
2 "Duran then placed appellant under arrest."
2 "Appellant first makes a broad attack on Guam Criminal and Correctional Code Â§28.45 and Â§28.50, alleging that they are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad."
2 "The Government's witness, Mr. Duran, admitted he did not see appellant's entire performance since he entered the Sandy You club after appellant had begun her dance."
2 "From this admittedly partially-observed performance, appellant argues that it was impossible for Duran to describe appellant's entire performance to the jury and therefore, it was impossible for the jury to determine whether the performance, as a whole, was in fact obscene."

2 "On February 5, 1976, the appellants sued the government of Guam on a cause of action alleging that the Government's failure to renew their teaching contracts was in violation of a 1972 collective bargaining agreement between the Department of Education and the Guam Federation of Teachers."
2 "Dated this 12th day of December, 1978."
3 "Unfortunately, there was some confusion at the October 25, 1975 hearing because it was only halfway through the proceedings that the Court was made to realize that the appellant had not been formally charged with the commission of another offense, i.e. by indictment or information, as required by the Code."
3 "In this appeal, appellant contends: (1) that Guam Criminal and Correctional Code Â§28.45 and Â§28.50 are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and the prosecution of the appellant thereunder violated her constitutional right to due process of law; and (2) the evidence presented against appellant was insufficient to sustain a conviction because the government failed to produce any evidence of the community standards of Guam; and (3) the evidence presented was insufficient to sustain a conviction because the jury was deprived of the opportunity to consider appellant's performance as a whole in reaching its determination as to whether or not she violated Guam's obscenity law."
3 "We now turn to appellant's contention that Guam's obscenity statute fails to comply with the specificity requirements of Miller v. California and is therefore unconstitutional on its face."
3 "Appellant argues that the examples set forth in Miller describe sexual conduct while the Guam statute does not provide any definition or any example of what forms of sexual conduct are being regulated."
3 "Appellant also contends that judicial interpretation of the Guam obscenity statute to include the Miller specificity requirements does not rectify the statute's unconstitutionality."
3 "The rationale for this proposition is that the Miller Court had included in its opinion language to the effect that""... existing state statutes, as construed heretofore or hereafter, may well be adequate."""
3 "Appellant argues that this reference to statutes ""existing"" at the time Miller was decided precludes judicial construction of statutes passed after the decision, and therefore Guam's statute, which had been passed approximately three years after Miller, is not capable of being ""saved"" by judicial construction."
3 "In an alternative context, appellant contends that even if judicial interpretation of the Guam obscenity statute to include the specificity requirements is valid, such construction does not cure the constitutional defect as applied to appellant."
3 "This contention is premised on the proposition that the Guam statute is facially defective, a proposition with which we are not in agreement."
3 "The argument, however, is that the definition of obscenity under Miller is a completely separate requirement from the requirement of a specific definition of the sexual conduct being prohibited, and that any construction of the Guam statute to include the Miller specificity requirements is unconstitutional because the construction could only have been made subsequent to appellant's arrest."
3 "The question that must first be answered is whether the phraseology ""obscene act"" and obscene exhibition of his (sic) body"" was sufficient as notice to appellant that her conduct was proscribed."
3 "Appellant's next contention is that the evidence presented against her at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction in that the Government failed to produce any evidence of the community standards of Guam."
3 "Appellant's final contention is that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction because the jury was deprived of the opportunity to consider appellant's performance as a whole in reaching its determination as to whether or not appellant violated Guam's obscenity law."
3 "In a prosection under this article, the question whether the predominant appeal of material or of a performance is to prurient interest shall be determined with reference to average adults, unless it appears from the nature of the material or performance, or from the circumstances of its dissemination, distribution, or exhibition, that it is designed for a clearly defined deviant sexual group or for children, in which case the question of predominant appeal shall be determined with reference to the intended recipient group."
3 "The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether ""the average person, applying contemporary community standards"" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (citations omitted); (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a"
3 "This is an interlocutory appeal after the Trial Court granted Defendant's motion to suppress a firearm which was seized after a search warrant was issued for the search of Defendant's house."
3 "The sole issue before us is whether the affidavit and the testimony given to the judge issuing the search warrant were legally sufficient."
3 "If the warrant issued upon a showing of fact which was inherently incredible or false or deliberately misleading, the warrant was issued without probable cause."
3 "Appellants' claim for relief is based on a 1972 Three-Year Collective Bargaining Agreement which provides that all off-island teachers whose performance had been rated satisfactory would be offered similar reemployment by March 1 of the teacher's termination year, so long as the government of Guam policies provide for such hiring of teachers ."
3 "Appellants contend that the notice requirements under the Claims Act were substantially complied with because plaintiffs followed the grievance procedures contained in Article IV of the 1972 Collective Bargaining Agreement, thus giving the Government at least indirect notice of their desire to bring suit."
3 "Appellants also argue that the sovereign immunity doctrine does not prevent litigants from seeking equitable relief compelling government officials to perform their duties properly (in this case requiring the Department of Education to issue contracts which become effective retroactively with full pay)."
3 "This appeal concerns the revocation of appellant's release on bail by the Superior Court on October 24, 1975."
4 "Although the Government tried to argue that the Complaint filed against the accused was sufficient for the Superior Court to have revoked his bail, Section 1.17 of the Guam Criminal Procedure Code clearly states that an information may not be filed until there has been a preliminary examination and an order holding defendant to answer under Section 45.80."
4 "No where in the Guam Criminal Procedure Code does the mere filing of a complaint empower the court to take such action, and the Superior Court must be charged with uniformly applying all section of the Guam Criminal Procedure Code."
4 "Certainly, minimum standards of due process require at least a few hours notice so that counsel may intelligently protect his client's rights."
4 "The October 24, 1975 revocation of defendantâ€™s release on bail is reversed, and the defendant is ordered released on the same conditions as previously existed, with the additional condition that he stay at his parents' house and observe a curfew between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m."
4 "In a July 19, 1979 Opinion, the District Court determined that a three-judge panel is not required to hear appeals relating to bail hearings."
4 "Section 28.50 of the Code provides in relevant part:"
4 "We note first that obscenity can manifest itself in conduct as well as through means of verbal and pictorial expression, Kaplan v. California, 93 S. Ct. 2680, 2683-2684 (1973), and that States have greater power to regulate nonverbal, physical conduct than to suppress depictions or descriptions of the same behavior."
4 "We also recognize that the search for guidance in separating unprotected obscenity from other sexually oriented but constitutionally protected forms of expression has historically been one of the more difficult tasks of reviewing courts."
4 "A year after Miller was decided, in Hamling v. United States, 94 S. Ct. 2887 (1974), the Court was presented with the question of whether its rejection of the third part of the Memoirs test and its revision in Miller indicated that the Memoirs formulation was determined to be unconstitutionally vague."
4 "In Marks v. United States, 97 S. Ct. 990 (1977), referring to the third part of the Memoirs test the Court added that ""clearly it was thought that some conduct which would have gone unpunished under Memoirs would result in conviction under Miller."""
4 "Because of this, the Court reasoned that they were entitled to jury instructions requiring the jury to acquit unless it found that the materials involved in the charge were, in accordance with the Memoirs standard, ""utterly without redeeming social value."""
4 "In Miller and Handing, the Court reiterated its pronouncement in Roth v. United States, 77 S. Ct. 1304 (1957):"
4 "Regarding the ""contemporary community standards"" to be applied in judging appellant's conduct, the trial judge charged the jury as follows:"
4 "We hold that this charge to the jury was sufficient and proper, and find no merit in appellant's attack on the failure of the Government to produce evidence of the community standards of Guam."
4 "Section 28.45(a) of the Guam Criminal and Correctional Code states:"
4 "We also recognize that it is probable that appellant had not completed"
4 "The third criterion of Section 28.45(a) is that the performance must be ""utterly without redeeming social importance."""
4 "When the verdict of a jury is challenged, the general rule of applicability is that its verdict must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it."
4 "See, for example, J. Harlan's separate opinion in Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. Dallas, 88 S. Ct. 1298 (1968), wherein he expressed that the ""intractable obscenity problem"" had led to ""a variety of views among the members of the Court unmatched in any other course of constitutional adjudication."""
4 "See Roth v. United States, 77 S. Ct. 1304 (1975)."
4 "i.e. ""all States other than Oregon."""
4 "The Court cited laws enacted in Oregon and Hawaii as examples of state laws directed at depiction of specifically defined physical conduct, as opposed to expression."
4 "A person is guilty of a misdemeanor if he knowingly or recklessly:"
4 "(h) performs an obscene act or otherwise presents obscene exhibition of his body in a public place."
4 "Section 28.45 of the Guam Criminal and Correctional Code states:"
4 "Any material or performance is obscene if considered as a whole, applying contemporary community standards:"
4 "1. its predominant appeal is to prurient interest;"
4 "2. it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in the description or representation of nudity, sex or excrÃ©tion; and"
4 "3. it is utterly without redeeming social importance."
4 "Section 28.50 of the Guam Criminal and Correction Code states:"
4 "A person is guilty of misdemeanor if he knowingly or recklessly:"
4 "a.sends or brings any obscene material into this territory for sale or distribution;"
4 "b. prepares, published, prints, exhibits, distributes, or offers to distribute any obscene material;"
4 "c. possesses any obscene material with intent to distribute it is violation of this article;"

4 "g. employs or uses a minor under the age of eighteen years to do or assist in doing any of the acts described in this section; or"
4 "h. performs an obscene act or otherwise presents an obscene exhibition of his body in public place."
4 "In Miller, the Court stated that:"
4 "we now confine the permissible scope of ."
4 "regulation to works which depict or describe sexual conduct."
4 "That conduct must be specifically defined by the applicable state law, as written or authoritatively construed (footnote omitted)."
4 "A state offense must also be limited to works which, taken as whole, appeal to the prurient interest in sex, which portray sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and which, taken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value."
4 "In order to find that live conduct is obscene, each of the following elements must be proved, and there are five:"
4 "And five, it is conduct which, taken as a whole is utterly without redeeming social value or importance."
4 "The term utterly without redeeming social value or importance, as used in these instructions, means that the alleged obscene matter must be totally devoid of any redeeming literary, scientific of artistic value or any other of social importance."
4 "The determination of whether matter is obscene is not to be made by weighing its social value or importance against its alleged prurient appeal for it is not obscene unless it is utterly without social value or importance."
4 "In determining the question of whether the alleged obscene live conduct is utterly without redeeming social importance, you may consider the circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution or publicity, and particularly, whether such circumstances indicate that the live conduct was being commercially exploited by the defendant for the sake of its prurient appeal."
4 "Such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the conduct and can justify the conclusion that the conduct is utterly without any redeeming social importance."
4 "The weight, if any, to which such evidence is entitled is a matter for you to determine."
4 "(a) Patently offensive representation or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts normal or perverted, actual or simulated."

4 "The Government Code of Guam, Â§Â§6500.00 et seq, provides for such waiver and Â§6500.05 of the Claims Act requires that all claims against the Government must be filed within six months from the date the claim arose."
4 "while the Court in Miller did refer to ""specific prerequisites"" which ""will provide fair notice to a dealer in such materials,"" 413 U.S., at 27, 93 S. Ct. at 2616, the Court immediately thereafter quoted the language of the Court in Roth v. United States, 354 U.S., at 491-492, 77 S. Ct., at 1312-1313, concluding with these words:"

4 "In Hamling, the court stated that:"
4 "The definition of obscenity ... is not a question of fact, but one of law; the word is not merely a generic or descriptive term, but a legal term of art. (citations omitted) ."
4 "The legal definition of obscenity does not change with each indictment; it is a term sufficiently definite in legal meaning to give a defendant notice of the charge against him."

4 "When the affidavit is not based on direct personal observation of the affiant, the judge issuing the search warrant must be informed of some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concludes that the informant is credible or his information reliable."
4 "The Trial Court did not find (nor is there anything in the record to so indicate) that there is a false statement in the affidavit or testimony of Officer Klinge or that Klinge demonstrated reckless disregard for the truth which would require an evidentiary hearing."
4 "On April 14, 1976, the Superior Court dismissed appellants' complaint for failure to comply with the Government of Guam Claims Act."
4 "The Organic Act of Guam empowers the local legislature to waive sovereign immunity in tort and contract actions against the Government to the extent which it deems desirable."
1 "No indictment or information has been filed against the appellant, and there is nothing to show that any condition of release has been willfully violated by the defendant."
1 "Also, it seems that appellant's counsel was not given adequate notice and time to prepare for a hearing on the revocation of his client's bail."
1 "Upon review of appellant's contentions, we find no basis for reversal, and accordingly AFFIRM the judgment of the trial court."
1 "Accordingly, we find that appellant suffered no loss by use of the ""social importance"" standard in Â§Â§28.45(a)(3) and 28.45(c) of the Guam Criminal and Correctional Code."
1 "While there can be no question that Miller requires sexual conduct to be specifically defined by the applicable law, we believe that appellant misconceives the exactitude with which such specificity is to be defined."
1 "Our reading of Â§28.45 and Â§28.50 in the light of the Court's statements in Roth, 12 200-ft. Reels and Hamling leads us to conclude that, although the language of the Guam obscenity statue is at variance with the guidelines set out verbatim in Miller, the language is sufficiently specific under Miller as to be absent of any constitutional defect."
1 "It is evident that the Court felt existing state obscenity laws which were otherwise constitutionally valid would continue to be valid, either as written or construed, in the indeterminate future."
1 "We find that it would be inconsistent with notions of due process, and therefore inconceivable as in inference, to interpret the Court's meaning to be that an obscenity statute currently active in a State's law may or may not be constitutional, depending solely on whether it was enacted prior to or after the decision in Miller."
1 "While we acknowledge that the language of the Guam statute is in large part archaic, we do not find that it is on that basis alone unconstitutional."
1 "Nevertheless, a review and disposition of whether Â§28.45 and Â§28.50 are unconstitutional as applied to the specific conduct of appellant is appropriate here."
1 "We find that the language of the statute provided appellant with adequate notice of the illegality of her conduct, and that therefore it is not incumbent upon us to reach the propounded issue of whether the statute was unconstitutional as construed to apply to appellantâ€™s conduct."
1 "The use of the terminology ""obscene act"" and ""obscene exhibition"" is therefore sufficiently definite in legal meaning as to have provided appellant with notice of the charge against her."
1 "Accordingly, we conclude that the language of Â§28.45 and Â§28.50, and particularly that language of Â§28.50(y), gave adequate notice to appellant that her conduct was within the prohibition of the statute."
1 "The judgment of the Superior Court is AFFIRMED."
1 "Neither the prosecution nor the defense shall be required to introduce expert witness testimony concerning the obscene character of the material"
1 "We do not hold ."
1 "that all States"
1 "Your own personal, social or moral views on material such as that shown in the complaint may not be considered for purposes of determining the obscenity of the material here in question."
1 "In that regard, you may consider evidence concerning the standards of any local community in Guam for such bearing, if any, as you may determine it has upon the question of what the territory-wide standard is."
1 "In reviewing the Child Welfare Services Social Worker's reports, it is evident that termination is in the child's best interest."
1 "In view of the foregoing, the mother-child relationship is severed."
1 "Petition to terminate is GRANTED."

1 "Be that as it may, this does not alter the original information presented to the issuing magistrate."
1 "If, after setting aside any material that is the subject of the charge of falsity or reckless disregard of the truth, there is sufficient content in the warrant affidavit to support a finding of probable cause, an evidentiary hearing is not even required."
1 "This condensed statement of the contents of the Affidavit is sufficient to point out that ""CRI"" had given information to the police concerning two buys before the one at Rico's house and furnished information which had never been found to be inaccurate."
1 "However, no showing of this kind was made in the trial court."
1 "The trial judge erroneously substituted his own view of the facts for that of the issuing officer after taking evidence which was not relative to the issue of the reliability of ""CRI"" as an informant."
1 "After reading the affidavit and the transcript of the testimony of Officer Klinge, we find that the information"

1 CONCURRENCE
1 "Having read the Opinion in this appeal, I hereby concur with the result reached by the Superior Court's dismissal of plaintiff's action for failure to comply with the Government of Guam Claims Act be affirmed."
1 "While the Superior Court might have had the power to automatically revoke the defendant's release on bail if the above conditions had been satisfied, the record makes it clear that the Superior Court based its revocation on the mere fact that a complaint had been filed."
0 "Here none of the conditions enumerated in Sections 40.65, 40.70 and 40.75 of the Guam Criminal Procedure Code were present; thus the better course would have been for the Government to prepare an Order to Show Cause with timely notice of hearing, so that a complete and effective record could be prepared."
0 "The constitutional standards provided in Miller and its attendant cases are those which are applicable to the Issue raised in this appeal, and it is on this basis that we proceed in our review of appellant's contentions."
0 "Before proceeding to appellant's Miller-based contentions, we."
0 "observe that the Court expressly provided that it did not adopt as a constitutional standard the ""utterly without redeeming social value"" test (cf. part (c) of the Miller test), incorporated in part three of the test articulated in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 86 S. Ct. 975, 977 (1966), and provided in Â§28.45(a)(3) of the Guam Criminal and Correctional Code."
0 "Memoirs was not rejected because it was so vague as to deprive criminal defendants of adequate notice but because it represented a departure from prior definitions of obscenity"
0 "Because the tantamount language ""utterly without redeeming social importance"" is expressly a part of the Guam statute, the trial judge in the instant case was required, as was the trial judge in the instant case was required, as was the trial judge in Marks, to instruct the jury on this standard."
0 "With receipt of the above instructions, the jury was sufficiently appraised of the more restrictive burden on the government than that required by Miller."
0 "It is notable that even appellant concedes that the Guam statute does forbid the presentation of an obscene performance (appellant's brief at p.5)."
0 "Only if it was not does the issue of statutory construction as applied to appellant's conduct become viable for review."
0 "In Re Giannini, 69 Cal. 2d 653, 72 Cal. Rptr."
0 "655, 446 P.2d 535 (1968), cited by appellant in support of her argument, is inapposite to the current state of the law regarding ""contemporary community standards."""
0 "Neither expert testimony on community standards, Hamling v. United States, supra at 2912-2914, nor instructions on precisely what ""community"" to consider, Jenkings v. Georgia, 418 U.S. 153, 157 (1974), are constitutionally required."
0 "Further the possibility that different juries might reach different conclusions as to the same material does not render a statute unconstitutional."
0 "We emphasize that the performance must not only have social importance to be constitutionally protected, but that the social importance must be sufficient to redeem the obscene, or unprotected part of the performance."
0 "Thus, even if appellant's performance opened with a Shakespearean recitation and climaxed with an aria from the ""Barber of Seville,"" a jury could nevertheless have found that, notwithstanding whatever social importance was gleaned from the entire performance, it was insufficient to redeem the obscene act or exhibition."
0 "Based on the evidence before it, the jury could have inferred that the appellant's performance would have been obscene irrespective of its context, and returned a verdict of guilty based on that inference."
0 "Because of this, we are not inclined to disturb the verdict as rendered."
0 "When circumstances of production, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material or a performance is being exploited by the defendant for the sake of its prurient appeal, evidence of such circumstances is admissible in a prosecution under this article upon the upon question whether the material or performance is utterly without redeeming social importance."
0 """Many decisions have recognized that these terms of obscenity statutes are not precise."
0 "This Court, however, has consistently held that lack of precision is not itself offensive to the requirements of due process."
0 "...[T]he Constitution does not require impossible standards; all that is required it that the language conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices."
0 "These words, applied according to the proper standard for judging obscenity ... give adequate warning to conduct proscribed and mark"
0 "The Miller cases, important as they were in enunciating a constitutional test for obscenity to which a majority of the Court subscribed for the first time in a numbers of years, were intended neither as legislative drafting handbooks or as manuals of jury instructions..."
0 "the various component parts of the constitutional definition of obscenity need not be alleged ... in order to establish its sufficiency ."
0 "The factual situation in this case is sufficient grounds for termination."

2 "We hold that off-the-record discussions such as occurred here are prohibited in grand jury proceedings, and accordingly vacate the judgment of the Superior Court."
2 "The off-the-record discussions being sufficient grounds for reversal, we decline to reach the other Issue raised in this consolidated appeal."
2 "Indictments dismissed without prejudice."
2 "The general rule regarding the recording of grand jury proceedings is that, in the absence of statute, the grand jury is not required to transcribe or record the proceedings brought before it."
2 """Though recordation of grand jury testimony is the better practice and is required by judicial order, such recordation is not mandated by (the United States) Constitution."""
2 "In some jurisdictions it is required by statute that minutes of grand jury proceedings are to be kept, but are not to be revealed or to be made available, except to the court, prosecuting attorney, and persons to whom the court grants permission to inspect them, and, in the last instance, only upon notice to and after hearing the prosecuting attorney."
2 "Elsewhere, a court may require production of minutes of grand jury proceedings upon a showing that there is a particularized need or compelling necessity for such disclosure."
2 "It has been held in at' least one jurisdiction that a criminal defendant is under certain circumstances constitutionally entitled to some part of a grand jury transcript, and that under its rule-making power a court may amend existing Criminal Procedure Rules to require the recording of all evidence before the qrand jury."
2 "The law in the Territory of Guam provides for equally liberal recordation and disclosure of grand jury proceedings, including the affirmative duty of delivering a copy of the original transcript to each defendant or his attorney."
2 "The record on appeal does not disclose the contents of the discussion held off the record, or the circumstances attendant to that discussion."
2 "It is the government's impropriety in the proceedings as well as the prejudice resulting therefrom."
2 "But the statute is explicit in its statement that the grand jury proceedings are to be recorded, and no allowance is made for off-the-record discussions during the course of the grand jury proceedings."
2 "There is a certain danger in allowing off-the-record discussions to occur at any time and under any circumstances during official grand jury proceedings."

2 "(b) The transcript shall not be open to the public until ten days after the delivery to the defendant or his attorney."

2 "This matter came for hearing on May 16, 1980, to consider defendant Government's motion to strike certain documents attached in support of plaintiff's motion in opposition to summary judgment."
2 "Plaintiff then orally moved the court to prohibit the Government from using any information which the defendant was precluded from using pursuant to order of the court dated September 11, 1979."

2 "At the time said order was issued, the Government did not make any objection to the blanket prohibition."
2 "It is not beyond the discretion of this Court to interpret a summary judgment proceeding as part of the overall trial, and therefore to interpret such a prohibition as applicable to such proceeding."
2 "Plaintiff's motion prohibiting defendant from using the information referred to is hereby GRANTED."

2 "This case came before the court for trial."
2 "During the course of the trial, testimony of plaintiff's witnesses disclosed that at the time of the incident alleged in plaintiff's complaint, plaintiff was driving a car belonging to the Guam Power Authority, that his car was assigned to plaintiff for this work, and at the time of the incident, plaintiff was driving the car to its assigned parking space, pursuant to standing instructions of his employer, the Guam Power Authority, at the time of the incident upon which the complaint is based, plaintiff was within the scope of his employment."
2 "Plaintiff did not willfully cause his own injury."

Cristal, Assistant Attorney General, and Doris Camina, Director, Bureau of Budget and Management Research, a public official, appearing without counsel, whereupon the papers filed by the petitioner and the stipulation filed by the respondent and petitioner were received, the case having been argued and submitted to the Court for its decision and the Court having duly considered the matters submitted and the argument of counsel, and being fully advised in the premises, did render and file its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and, pursuant to said Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law,"
2 "14-83 is null and void with respect to all grants and appropriations made by the United States to the government of Guam where the grant or appropriation provides one hundred percent of the funding for a specific project or purpose and which grant or appropriation makes no provision for local legislative control."
2 "This Memorandum Order follows a February 22, 1980 Order of the District Court which required the immediate return of Petitioners STRAUSS, ROOT, SANTOS and REYES to the Halfway House Community Correctional Facility from which they were transferred without due process of law."
2 "While the facts are different in each of the above-captioned cases, there can be no question that each Petitioner was removed from the Work Release Program of the Department of Corrections and returned to the Guam Penitentiary, Adult Main Facility without a proper hearing."
2 "A prisoner has certain vested rights, similar to a parolee, once he is afforced the benefits of participating in a work-release program."
2 "No evidence was presented by the Department of Corrections to suggest that there were exigent circumstances which would justify the removal of the petitioners from the work-release hearing without a prior hearing."
2 "Strauss was returned to the Adult Main Facility on December 5, 1979, where at a preliminary hearing the charges were read to him and he was asked how he wanted to plead."
2 "Strauss was then put in closed confinement for approximately a week where he was restricted to his cell for twenty-four hours a day, except for a half hour to take a shower and fresh air."
2 "The charges brought against Strauss had to do with an incident occurring around Thanksgiving when he called a local newspaper to complain about the fact that certain holiday furloughs had been cancelled."
2 "On December 11, 1979 a final hearing was held, which resulted in Strauss permanent removal from the work-release program and a demotion in step level."
2 "Root was returned to the Adult Main Facility sometime around March 26, 1978, and he was put into solitary confinement without the benefit of a hearing."
2 "On April 28, 1978 three was a reclassification hearing, where, according to his testimony, he was not given an opportunity to question witnesses regarding the assault charges brought against him."
2 "Santos was taken out of the work-release program and returned to the Adult Main Facility on January 6, 1980, where he was placed in solitary confinement."
2 "There was a final hearing on January 18, 1980, where he was charged with possession of alcohol and antagonizing another inmate."
2 "After the final hearing, he was placed in closed confinement for thirty days, with an additional thirty-day probation."
2 "Reyes was returned to the Adult Main Facility on November 25, 1978."
2 "He was immediately placed in closed confinement until a hearing on December 13, 1978 when he was found guilty of fighting with another inmate."
2 "Prison officials allegedly the denied Reyes' request to produce certain witnesses."
2 "As developed above, the removal of a prisoner from a work-release program can result in a grievous loss of employment and certain due process standards attach to protect these rights to participate in the Step IV program."
2 "The February 22, 1980 Order of the District Court, returning the petitioners to the Halfway House Facility, is not a ruling on the merits of the charges against them."
2 "The Order was issued so that petitioners' partially vested rights could be reestablished fully, pending a fair and adequate hearing seeking to divest any such rights to work on the outside."
2 "The Government has failed to show any justification for not conducting an adequate hearing before petitioners' actual removal from the work-release program, and for not affording petitioners their full due process rights at such a hearing."
2 "Indeed, many of the 'core values of unqualified liberty' which the Supreme Court recognized that parolees enjoy, see Morrissey, supra, 408 U.S. at 482, 92 S.Ct."
2 "Like a parolee, a convict on work-release can pursue employment or education."
2 "He is eligible for leaves to renew contacts with his family."
2 "He may also be released to participate in unsupervised activities in the community, such as shopping, recreation and visiting friends."
2 "This matter came on for hearing on April 4, 1980 to hear defendant, Gretchen Luttrell's, motion to quash service of summons by publication based on insufficiency of process."
2 "This court, upon review of all the records submitted herein, denies defendant's motion for the following reasons."
2 "Defendant bases her motion on the inconsistencies arising between the original summons mailed to her November 16, 1979 pursuant to the original complaint, and the summons she subsequently received December 31, 1979 mailed pursuant to plaintiff's amended complaint and order of the court for service by publication issued December 18, 1979."
2 "The court will not consider the sufficiency of the summons mailed November which was not directed by the court for publication."
2 "A defendant must respond prior to the expiration of the order."
2 "Plaintiff contends that even if a defect were to exist in the summons, over 100 days have since elapsed and as yet defendant has not filed a response, thus inferring that any response now would be untimely."
4 "The defendant interposed as a defense to the granting of such a motion that Â§139 of the Civil Code which provides for the payment of child support by fathers, but not by mothers, is a violation of equal protection of the law on the basis of sex."
4 "There can be little doubt that Civil Code Â§139 is exactly the sort of law condemned as a violation of the equal protection of the laws by Orr v. Orr 99 S.Ct."
4 "First, Civil Code Â§138 provides a basis for the award of child support which is not sex based."
4 "14-28(b), which provides ""Equality of Rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex.14-28(b), which provides ""Equality of Rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex."
4 "14-28(b) speaks to repeal to the extent of inconsistency, not the voiding of statutes which are violative of equal protection, it is the court's task to determine whether Civil Code Â§139 must be held repealed in whole or in part."

4 "Pursuant to Government Code Â§6500.15, trial was before the court, without jury."

4 "Further, Government Code Â§21512(c), which was passed as part of the Guam Power Authority Act of 1968, as originally passed, specifically states that the manager, secretary, treasurer, comptroller and attorney of the Authority are not within the classified service of the Government of Guam."

0 "Second, although this statute as written is violative of the Constitution, and by authority of Orr v. Orr void, this court need not reach this result, or indeed a federal constitutional issue, in this case."
0 "Though the test is imprecise, a court must weigh the general interest in retaining the statute against the court's reluctance to extend legislation to those not previously covered."
0 "Such an inquiry may lead a court into examination of legislative purpose, the overall statutory scheme, statutory arrangements in connected fields and the needs of the public."
0 """When a statute, either alone or in conjunction with another statute or statutes, infringes on constitutional rights, this court has an obligation to make every effort to salvage the statute by an appropriate exclusion so long as legislative intent will not be frustrated thereby."""
0 "Although plaintiff has no record of the cancellation the testimony received indicates that a record of the cancellation might not have been made or if made, might have been destroyed."
0 "It therefore appears that Mr. Cate would not be liable for any of the present judgment."
0 "Thus, it is required in Guam that a transcript be made and that copies be provided for both the prosecuting attorney and each defendant."
0 "This being the law, we find merit in appellants' claim of possible prejudice arising from the failure of the Territorial Grand Jury to record all of the proceedings before them."
0 "The government maintains that the indictments should not be dismissed because of two off-the-record discussions in the absence of a showing as to the nature of the discussions and prejudice accruing to the appellants."
0 "Granted, we are not able to say with any certitude that appellants were in fact prejudiced by these discussions."
0 "But we are not willing to speculate that they were not, nor should a defendant be asked to guess and be burdened with proving that he was."
0 "The language of the court in Pipes is equally appropriate to the matter now on appeal before this Court."
0 "Further, while we are not aware of the nature of the off-the-record discussions, we find it necessary to add that, although it is the role of the prosecutor to draw such indictments as the grand jury directs, he may not give advice as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence in any matter, nor may he in any way seek to influence the grand jury to find or not to find any indictment, nor may he take part in any of the grand jury's deliberations, as these are all matters wholly within the exclusive province of the grand jury."
0 "Off-the-record discussions may lend credence to such criticism."
0 "The Government further contends that such documents are hearsay, violate the Best Evidence Rule, and are not properly authenticated."
0 "Plaintiff, on oral argument, stated that the challenged documents were submitted for the purpose of estopping the Government from asserting as a defense the untimely filing of plaintiff's claim and action."
0 "This Court finds that Rule 408 creates an exception for the admissibility of evidence otherwise inadmissible if offered for purposes other than to prove liability."
0 "Plaintiff does not seek to establish that the documents of compromise are an admission of liability on the part of the Government, but merely that negotiations were ongoing they are admissible."
0 "With regard to the Best Evidence argument, where an original is unobtainable, or within the control of the party opponent, the Rule creates an exception for the introduction of copy in lieu of the original."
0 "Based on the foregoing, this Court finds no ground to strike the documents as submitted by plaintiff, and accordingly DENIES the Government's motion."
0 "This Court believes that the order of September 11th clearly circumvents this argument, and that said order is an unconditional prohibition upon the Government from using any information relating to questions not properly answered."
0 "1 During the course of the trial, the plaintiff's proof having established that plaintiff was within the scope of his employment at the time of the incident, the court itself raised the issue of whether or not this action was barred under the Workmen's compensation Law, Government Code Sections 37000 et."
0 "If plaintiff is not an employee of the Government of Guam, then Â§37005 is no bar to this action."
0 "However, Government Code Â§21502 is, at first blush, ambiguous."
0 "If the Guam Power Authority is ""autonomous"" as set forth in Â§21502, how can an agency relationship exist between it and the Government of Guam?"
0 "Yet, the same Â§21502 sets forth that the Guam Power Authority is an ""instrumentality"" of the Government of Guam."
0 "Where the court is faced with two interpretations, one of which would hold the statute wholly void and the other of which would uphold the statute, it is clear that the legislative intent must be the latter interpretations."
0 "Where it appears clearly from the tenor of the statute that employees of the Authority are employees of the Government, and the Legislature specifically exempts certain people from the operation of the statue, it is strong evidence that the"
0 "Although the Fund may recoup these payments from the Authority on an annual basis pursuant to this Section, the liability for Workmen's Compensation payments is upon the Government of Guam."
0 "Thus, the bare fact that compensation to plaintiff under the Worlonen's Compensation Law would come from the Government of Guam's Workmen's Compensation Fund is sufficient to bar plaintiff's claim under Government Code Â§37005."

0 "This is not to minimize the seriousness of the offenses charged; however, benefits afforded a prisoner on a work-release program are similar to those of a prisoner on parole, thus requiring greater rights to a hearing than might normally be associated with general prison discipline and administrative procedures."
0 "The uncontradicted testimony of Root and Reyes suggest that the right to confront and produce witnesses was limited when their cases were heard."
0 "In some cases the gravity of certain offenses could justify the disciplinary removal of a prisoner from work release prior to a full hearing; however, no exigent circumstances to justify such removal have been shown by the Government to exist in the cases at bar."

2 "Plaintiff was represented by David Dooley, and defendant was represented by Davor Pevec and Thomas Himrod."
2 "It cannot be presumed that the legislature intended to undo or repeal an act to which it had but just assigned a valid function."
2 "The matter came for hearing on a motion to vacate sentence in the above-entitled Court before the Honorable Paul J. Abbate on March 19, 1980."
2 "The defendant was represented by Assistant Public Defender Richard Pipes and the Territory of Guam was represented by Deputy Attorney General R. Barrie Michelsen."
2 "The Court received testimony and oral arguments from both parties."
2 "Defendant's expressed purpose for vacating sentence was to allow him the opportunity to perfect an appeal of his conviction."
2 "The evidence offered showed that his original appeal in 1976 was not perfected as a result of a clerical error by the staff of the Court."
2 "Within the federal case law there are decisions where the appellate court did not accept a notice of appeal that resulted from procedural correction of a clerical error by the method being attempted herein."
2 "The Court notes that defendant's proper and least problematic method to obtain his appeal is by way of writ of habeas corpus in the District Court, or in this Court."
2 "This matter comes before the Court on Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration filed July 14, 1978."
2 "Defendant Guam Memorial Hospital, (GMH), filed its motion for summary judgment on May 26, 1978 asserting the applicability of the Government Claims Act (GC Sections 6500 et seq.) to suits against GMH."
2 "That motion was granted by an order filed July 13, 1978 which stated that ""plaintiff failed to comply with the Government Claims Act. ."
2 "The Court finds that the intent of the Legislature was to include Guam Memorial Hospital within the statutory scheme of that act."""
2 "Because of the possible wide ranging ramifications of the decision in this case the Court agreed to reconsider its prior decision on the basis of new evidence of the legislative intent."
2 "The transcript indicated that originally Â§49003(g) describing powers of Guam Memorial Hospital Authority read:"
2 "The discussion of May 11, 1977 dealt with the propriety of deleting any reference to the Government Claims Act, The transcript indicated that the language was deleted with full understanding that thereafter claims against GMH would not be paid through the Government Claims Fund but through GMH's own funds."
2 "Plaintiffs rely upon the transcript to bolster their original claim that the language of Government Code Â§49003(g), as it passed into law, did not cloak the Guam Memorial Hospital'with the protection of the Government Claims Act."
2 "Defendant maintains that this interpretation is in direct conflict with other provisions of the Government Code."
2 "All payments under this Act shall be made from the Government Claims Fund."
2 "Claims against the Commercial Port, and the Public Utility Agency, Guam Power Authority, Guam Economic Development Authority, Guam Telephone Authority, Guam International Airport Authority, Gaming Commission, Guam Transit Authority and Guam Memorial Hospital Authority, however, shall be paid only out of the funds of those agencies."""
2 "Section 9 of that Act provided that the provisions of Â§8 would expire automatically one year from the effective date of that act, which was December 24, 1975."
2 "It is the opinion of this Court that Â§6500.13 was revived by Â§6 of P.L."
2 "Defendant argues that it is impossible to reconcile plaintiff's position with the language of Â§6500.19 which mentions ""claims against"" GMH."
2 "Defendant argues that the correct interpretation of the various provisions is that the Claims Act procedures are applicable while in the event of liability, GMH funds, rather than Government Claims Fund, will be drawn against."
2 "However, it must be remembered that at the time of the May 11, 1977 deletion Â§6500.19 was already in effect."
2 "That section expressly states that the Government Claims Fund will not be used to pay for claims against GMH."
2 "Although the issue is not squarely before the Court at this time, it will be noted that ""claims against"" GMH in Â§6500.19 may in fact mean suits against Health Professionals employed by GMH."
2 "It is the holding of this Court that Government Claims Act procedures are not applicable to suits against Guam Memorial Hospital."
2 "This is a matter brought before the District Court pursuant to Â§1084 to Â§1097 of the Guam Code of Civil Procedure, dealing with Writs of Prohibition."
2 "However, rather than hear the motion to suppress, the Superior Court entertained an application to disqualify the Attorney General of Guam from acting as prosecutor in the case."
2 "On that same date an order was signed by the Honorable Paul J. Abbate, in which he disqualified the Attorney General's Office, due to an alleged conflict of interest, and in which the Presiding Judge then appointed a Special Prosecutor of his own choice."
2 "On December 5, 1979, a Stay Order wasâ€™ entered by the District Court, ordering the Superior Court to refrain from taking any further action in People v. Flores, supra, pending the final determination of a December 5, 1979 Writ of Prohibition filed by the Government."
2 "An initial hearing was had on this matter on December 17, 1979, with proceedings continued until December 27, 1979 so that the parties could have additional time to brief the Issue presented."
2 "This Memorandum Order results from the December 27, 1979 hearing on Writ of Prohibition, in which counsel for all interested parties appeared."
2 "This whole matter concerns several very important Issue of separation of power as delineated in the Organic Act of Guam, 48 U.S.C. Â§1421, et seq., and contained in the common law."
2 "Even though the Attorney General strenuously objected to the lack of notice and opportunity given to prepare, the Superior Court continued with the motion to disqualify when only a motion to suppress was scheduled to be heard."
2 "Also, only unsworn representations of counsel were considered, with no attempt to hear legally admitted evidence."
2 "The District Court sees no reason why it should make a de novo decision on matters which were not fully briefed and presented before the Superior Court of Guam."
2 "The November 26, 1979 Decision and Order of the Superior Court is vacated, and the Superior Court is ordered to schedule a hearing on the disqualification issue with full and adequate notice being given to counsel for both sides."
2 "The motion of defendants to vacate and set aside the Attachment issued by this Court, came on regularly for hearing the 28th day of July, 1972, David M. Shapiro, Esq., appearing for the plaintiff and Joaquin C. Arriola appearing for the defendants, and the Court, having heard the argument and statements of counsel, finds the facts as follows:"
2 "Defendants are residents of the Territory of Guam and in personam jurisdiction is readily available."
2 "On June 29, 1972, plaintiff filed its complaint against defendants on a guaranty instrument."
2 "Affidavit for Attachment and Undertaking on Attachment and obtained a Writ of Attachment from this Court."
2 "On July 14, 1972, the United States Marshal for the Territory of Guam issued his Notice of Levying on Real Property, and filed the same with the Department of Land Management, Government of Guam, under document No. 114073, on the same date."
2 "The filing and recordation of the Notice of Levying on Real Property in the Department of Land Management, Government of Guam, creates a lien on the property of the defendants."
2 "Defendants were served with summons and complaint, Writ of Attachment and Notice of Levying on Real Property, on July 18, 1972."
2 "The Court is of the opinion that he foregoing Order involves a controlling issue of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the Order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation."
2 "This matter came before the Court on defendant's summary judgment motion and motion to dismiss."
2 "Defendant was represented by Assistant Attorney General Roger Willmeth, the plaintiff was represented by Timothy Stewart."
2 "The motions were heard by Judge John P. Raker and decision was reserved."
2 "The Court first will examine this claim as regards the first and third causes of action."
2 "The first cause of action sounds in negligence, count one against defendant Taijeron and count two against defendant Aguigui."
2 "Plaintiff has plead $200.00 in damages on each count."
2 "The third cause of action is against defendant Taijeron for negligent supervision and claims $400,000 in damages."
2 "Each of these counts are against an individual defendant government employee and plead in excess of $100,000 damages."
2 "It is defendant's position that the Court lacks jurisdiction as Government Code Â§6500.10 prohibits actions against an individual defendant once a claim has been filed pursuant to the Government Claims Act, as was done in this case."
2 "The second claim that this Court lacks jurisdiction regards counts one and two of the fourth and fifth causes of action."
2 "These are once again against the individual named defendants, but in this instance based on allegations of intentional tort."
2 "Once again defendants base their claim that the Court lacks jurisdiction over these counts on a reading of Section 6500.10."
2 "Rather, it provides that judgment or settlement of a government claims action bars further action against the employee (6500.20)."
2 "Further, the Act only covers negligent torts, and sovereign immunity is not waived for intentional wrongs of the employee."
2 "The legislature has made the determination that it will make it possible to proceed against the territory rather than the employee on negligence claims."
2 "Thus employees are freed to some extent from concern about individual liability which make them overly cautious about their actions being found negligent and adversely affect their function as employees."
2 "The legislature determined that a similar rationale did not exist for intentional wrong doing by government employees."
2 "Thus the act would provide absolute protection for an intentional tort-feasor, while providing a recovery against no one, and would indemnify a negligent tort-feasor to the extent of $100,000."
2 "Beyond creating a chilling effect on filing a claim with the government because a plaintiff would lose all should he be mistaken in his theory, this reading also creates troublesome due process problems as such an irrevocable election would have to e made before the plaintiff has the opportunity for any sort of discovery."
2 "The election would have to be made before the filing of claim, let alone a law suit."
2 "The final motion to be disposed of is a summary judgment motion on the second cause of action."
2 "Resolution of this motion requires examination of the claim filed."
2 "But in Kauss summary judgment was granted where a plaintiff filed a claim for intentional acts, and later a complaint for negligence."
2 "Here there is no question that the claim and complaint sound in negligence."
2 "The notice of claim is not a pleading, neither is it a trap for the unwary."
2 "The claimant is not required to list his theories of recovery, but rather the facts which lead to liability."
2 "The Court notes that such a claim may often be prepared by a lay person of limited education."
2 "If the claim gives such facts as would enable the Government to investigate its liability, it should be judged sufficient."
2 "The government has all the tools of any civil suit to refine the plaintiff's theory before trial."
2 "Defendant was indicted for Theft by Deception on July 28, 1979."
2 "He moved successfully in the Superior Court to suppress certain statements made to his supervisor, on the theory that the statements resulted from a custodial interrogation where full Miranda warnings were not given."
2 "The government appeals, arguing that the mere fact that the defendant's supervisor told him to go upstairs and talk to certain agents did not result in a custodial interrogation."
2 "In response, the defendant argues that he was concerned that he might lose his job if he refused to answer certain questions and that he was afraid that he would be arrested if he left the office."
2 "law enforcement officials was such as to overbear petitioner's will to resist and bring about [a confession which was not] freely self-determined."
2 "The defendant was ordered by a superior immediately to appear in the Intelligence Division of the Department of Revenue and Taxation and certain questions were asked of him in the presence of the Department head, the special agent and a stenographer."
2 "The questioning lasted approximately an hour."
2 "Even though there were no guards or steel bars to detain the defendant, the totality of the circumstance confirms that this was custodial interrogation."
2 "A hearing having been held on 30 April and May 1, 1980 on the petitions that the minor be certified for prosecution as an adult person, and the Court having heard testimony of the witnesses and examined the exhibits admitted in evidence, and the Court having filed its decision:"
2 "That the minor is hereby ordered to remain in the Agana Lockup pending the next hearing in this matter."
2 "This appeal results from the trial court's order compelling settlement of a land sales contract."
2 "The merits as to the actual rights and obligation between the buyers and sellers are not subject of this appeal; the only issue before us is whether the January 8, 1979 Order of the Superior Court purporting to enforce a settlement agreement made to the court by the parties during trial was error."
2 "First, we have determined that the defendants-appellants may prosecute this appeal independently of any partnership agreement which it might have with other defendants."
2 "First, we agree with the defendants-appellants that the court committed error when it held that upon sale of the property in question the plaintiffs only had to pay Ten Thousand Dollars and then pay the remaining Ten Thousand Dollars in two yearly installments of Five Thousand Dollars."
2 "This order was in direct contradiction to the representation"
2 "Second, we must determine whether or not the court should have provided for a mortgage in favor of the defendants so that their right to secure payments due them under the settlement agreement would be protected."
2 "The plaintiffs have argued that as an appellate court we should not disturb the express findings of the trial court unless they are clearly erroneous."
2 "The several hundred page glut which made up the record in this case was totally unnecessary; based on the one issue on appeal, a record several pages long was all that was required."
2 "Ironically enough, the one key portion of the trial hearing relative to appeal was not even included in the transcripts which were transmitted from the Superior Court."
2 "Had the new Rules of Appellate Procedure been in effect during the pendency of this appeal, sanctions against the responsible attorneys would have been appropriate."
2 """Mr. Haut [counsel for plaintiffs]: In exchange on the part of the Defendants, the Plaintiffs will execute two (2) promissory notes."
2 "That covers the law suit and that takes care of that."
3 "The Government's Complaint alleges that Defendants, owners of a store on San VÃ­tores Road in Turnon Bay violated Â§17402 by displaying signs in Japanese without a translation into English or Chamorro."
3 "On July 16, 1980 Defendants moved the Court for a Judgment on the Pleadings asserting inter alia that Â§17402 is unconstitutional because the wording is vague and could lend itself to Overbroad interpretation."
3 "The Government asserts that Defendant ""has not carried the burden of affirmatively showing that as applied to him, the statute in unreasonable, unfair and oppressive."""
3 "At issue is the regulation of speech."
3 "The Government asserts that ""... there is certainly a reasonable relation between the requirement of a translation on advertising signs and the heretofore referenced public interests which the statute was enacted to protect."""
3 "The Government further asserts that ""these are not necessarily the exclusive public interests which the statute was enacted to protect..."", but rather, ""... it is possible that the Legislature formulated additional reasons for enacting the statute,"" (emphasis ours.)"
3 "It is unnecessarily restrictive and beyond a ""reasonable"" relationship to include all ""permitted signs"" in an effort to specifically regulate ""advertising signs""."
3 "Careful consideration has been given as to whether Â§17402 is more inclusive or more burdensome than necessary to further legitimate government purposes."
3 "Does this violate his freedom of expression?"
3 "Plaintiff contends that Â§6500.15 of the Government Code, which prohibits of jury trial in claims against the Government, is repealed by Â§680.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides for jury trial in ""all cases at law"" exceeding twenty dollars ($20.00)."
3 "The Territory's arguments to the contrary, the Court could vacate and resentence defendant under its broad powers pursuant to Â§1.07(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code."
3 "The basis of this motion is that this cause of action for negligent hiring, training and supervision of the defendant employees is not within the scope of the claim filed by plaintiff, and thus barred."
3 "The claim is for ""all injuries proximately caused by the negligence... of the Government of Guam, its officers and employees, for injuries arising out of the wrongful arrest and wrongful imprisonment of claimant.. .said wrongful arrest and wrongful imprisonment having occurred on May 1, 1976, and May 2, 1976."""
3 "The question is whether the claim is too broad, rather than too narrow as in Kauss."
4 "The Court has a duty to uphold Constitutional rights and to take a staunch position to protect them at the earliest opportunity so as to allow the legislature to correct any deficiencies by narrowly redrafting a statute restricting any such right."
4 """Although a statute may be neither vague, overbroad, nor otherwise invalid as applied to the conduct charged against a particular defendant, he is permitted to raise its vagueness or unconstitutional overbreadth as applied to others."""
4 """For even when pursuing a legitimate interest, a State may not choose means that unnecessarily restrict constitutionally protected liberty...."
4 "If the State has open to it a less drastic way of satisfying its legitimate interests, it may not choose a legislative scheme that broadly stifles the exercise of fundamental personal liberties."""
4 """So long as the statute remains available to the State the threat of prosecutions of protected expression is a real and substantial one."
4 "The Court believes that a law requiring any permitted sign, no matter how big or small, on any land, be it public or private, in any language other than Chamorro or English to have a translation into either which ""must predominate the sign"", [has] a chilling effect on such a protected mode of expression."
4 "Furthermore, this Court cannot change the law under the guise of construction so as to only apply to business entities."
4 """The rewriting of a statute for the purpose of bringing about a particular result is certainly not within the judicial function."""
4 "As the law stands, a U.S. citizen could be fined $1,000.00 for erecting a permitted sign on his front lawn reading only, ""America the Beautiful"", in Tagalog."
4 "The Director of Administration shall pay the amount allowed in approved settlement under Â§6500.10 or in a court judgment under Â§6500.11, except as otherwise expressly provided by law."
4 "However, common law rules of interpretation state that the repeal of a repealing statute operates to revive the original enactment where the repeal of the repealing statute is accomplished by express provision without additional legislation on the subject matter."
4 "It is worthy of note that in addition to the provisions dealing with health professionals, Â§6500.13 includes the limitations on liability which are an essential part of the Government Claims Act."
4 "(g) Sue or be sued in its own corporate name subject to the limitations and provisions of [the Government Claims Act. ]"
4 "(a) Government Health Professionals means any person who is licensed or certified to practice a â€˜healing art1 in Guam and is practicing that art within a Government of Guam facility as an agent of the Government of Guam."
4 "(b) The Government of Guam shall be liable in tort for damages arising from the negligent acts of Government Health Professionals performed within Government of Guam facilities as an agent of the Government of Guam at the request of the government."
4 "Government Health Professionals shall be considered as an agent of the Government of Guam within the meaning of Â§6500.20 of the Government Code."
4 "(c) For all claims, the Government of Guam shall not be liable for more than Thirty-Five Thousand Dollars ($35,000) in an action for wrongful death, nor for more than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in any other tort action."
4 "On the face of the authority submitted by the Government, People v. Carlos G. Camacho, [1 Guam R. 501] it seems evident that the Organic Act of Guam, 48 U.S.C. Â§1421, Â§1422, et seq., forbids the appointment of a special prosecutor by any body of government other than the Executive Branch."
4 "Such a position does not take, into account Government Code Â§6500.20, which specifically allows ""further proceedings against the employee"" if ""the Court certifies that it would have awarded the claimant more but for the limitations of 6500.13."""
4 "Guam's Government Claims Act differs from those of many other jurisdictions, for while the act waives the sovereign immunity of the territory, it does not indemnify or immunize the employee."
4 "Yet the reading of Â§6500.10 urged by defendants is that simply by plaintiff's' act of filing a claim with the government for alleged negligence an employee is completely immunized should it turn out that the act was intentional."
4 "Section 938 of the Guam Civil Code provides in part that ""Any party aggrieved may appeal in the cases prescribed in this Title."""
4 "See 4 Cal.Jur.3d, Appellate Review, Â§102, for an interpretation of the identical California statute."
4 "A comment about the appeal record is appropriate here, especially in light of the recent amendment to the District Court Rules of Appellate Procedure stating that sanctions will be imposed against counsel who unreasonably order excessive parts of the record (Rule 8(b))."
1 "The Court finds Â§17402 of the Government Code of Guam to be an unconstitutional infringement upon a citizen's First Amendment right to freedom of speech."

2 "While observing the house they saw several cars appear in front of the house, sound their horn, and the appellant go to each car and then return to the house."
2 "After a brief time they apprehended the appellant as he was leaving and with him they entered the house and searched it."
2 "Officer Geffert testified that to the best of his knowledge the appellant had been living in the house which they searched for about six months."
2 "In a bedroom which the appellant told the officers was his room, and where the officers saw letters and traffic tickets bearing appellantâ€™s name, and some clothing with the name or initial of Clyde Sewell on them, the officers found a match box containing two balloons with a white powder substance in them."
2 "Proof was offered that an analysis of the white powder substance in each of the balloons showed that it was barbituates."
2 "Appellant did not testify but called three witnesses whose testimony was that the appellant did not and had not lived in the house searched, but was living at another place; that appellantâ€™s father, Clyde William Sewell, his wife and son resided there, and that the clothing and tickets had the fatherâ€™s name C. W. Sewell on them."
2 "Mrs. Joyce Wisnoski, a sister of the appellant, testified that she was visiting in her fatherâ€™s and motherâ€™s home when it was searched; that appellant had left a short time before the officers entered the house with him, and that appellant lived at another place."

1 "The facts and circumstances in evidence are sufficient to warrant the juryâ€™s conclusion that the appellant possessed the barbituates as charged."
2 "Appellant complains of Officer Geffertâ€™s testimony that while they were in the room where the barbituates were found appellant stated it was his room."
2 "Appellant objected to anything he said on the ground he was under arrest; and the record shows that he was under arrest at the time."
2 "Appellantâ€™s statement that the room was his was admissible as res gestae because it was made during and coincident with the search of the house."
2 "The indictment alleged that appellant did with malice aforethought kill Kathryn Fay Wilkerson by beating and striking her with a bottle."
2 "The nude body of deceased was found lying on a bed in the room she occupied with appellant."
2 "There were numerous lacerations and bruises about the body, including a bruise over the cheek bone and cuts in the scalp, the largest being on the left side going to the bone."
2 "There was blood in the deceasedâ€™s hair and a pool of blood on the floor at the head of the bed, and glass from a broken half gallon bottle on the floor."
2 "Appellant told Officer Senkel that his wife had fallen off the bed and hit her head."

5 "Omitting the warning, which appears to conform to the requirements of Art. 727 C.C.P., the statement reads:"
2 "Dr. Ashworth, who did the autopsy, testified that there were some two dozen bruises and lacerations on different parts of the body, several of which were in the scalp, the longest a deep cut over the left side of the head, compatible with a blow to the"
2 "Dr. Ashworth testified that some of the bruises could be explained by the deceased having fallen on the floor, but others which produced serious internal injury would require a greater amount of force than would have been achieved by the body falling a relatively short distance, as from the height of a bed."
2 "He expressed the opinion that the cause of death was primarily a blow to the head, and the injury to the liver could have been had it occurred first."
2 "Appellant testified as a witness in his own behalf at the trial."
2 "His version of the death of his wife was that she had been drinking wine; that he got her to go to bed about 11:30, at which time she was very drunk."
2 "He left and was gone about an hour."
2 "Later she â€œsaid she was going to get something to drink from somebody and I asked her not to."
2 "She said, â€˜Well, I will show you/ so I kept begging her, not to get drunk again, because I didnâ€™t want her to get drunk."
2 "I just came in and I had been gone ten days, and she said, T will get something from somebody/ that is when I lost my temper and hit her on the side of the head with the wine bottle."
2 "What was she trying to do when you lost your temper?"
2 "She was trying to get by me, scuffling, trying to get by me to go get something to drink from some of the neighbors.â€"
2 "Appellant further testified that after striking her with the bottle he took his wife to the bathroom and washed her hair out, that she showed no anger about his hitting her with the bottle."
2 "â€œShe realized that I was only trying to do what was right for her and keep her from getting drunk again."
2 "She knew she had done wrong by getting drunk that morning and starting again.â€"
2 "After washing the blood off he put her on the bed, took her clothes off, covered her with a blanket or quilt and â€œgave her a towel and asked her to lie there â€” so her head wouldnâ€™t start bleeding again.â€"
2 "He left the room and resumed playing dominoes with a young boy on the porch."
2 "Later he heard a noise in the room and when he went in he found his wife on the floor."
2 "He told her to get back in bed but she said the floor was cool and she was sick at the stomach, but would be all right shortly and would get up."
2 "He checked on her later and found her half way under the bed, â€œI said, â€˜Good God, get in bed and lie down,â€™ and she said, â€˜No, I am still sick.â€™ I said, â€˜All right, lie there if you want to lie in that dirt,â€™ and I went to the bathroom."
2 "The complaint and information were filed in June 1957."
2 "I came back through and asked her again to get up and she said, â€˜No, I am still sick.â€™ I asked her if she wanted anything, and she said, â€˜No.â€™ I went out there and it started getting dark and we couldnâ€™t see to play dominoes, so I come in the house and her feet was on the other side of the bed and she was about halfway under the bed and I pulled my shirt off and told her, I said, â€˜Well, I might as well go to bed, you are no company to me today,â€™ I said, T might as well go to bed and forget about enjoying your company,â€™ and she didnâ€™t say, she didnâ€™t answer me, so I reached down in the ice box, got me a glass of water and ate a bite of celery and some beans and stood there nibbling on some cheese and shut the box and turned around to her and said, â€˜Get up, now, letâ€™s get in bed,â€™ and she didnâ€™t answer, * * * .â€"
2 "The charge of the court submitted murder with and without malice and aggravated assault, and the defense of accident, and instructed the jury to acquit unless they found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant voluntarily and intentionally killed the deceased and that her death was caused by beating and striking with a bottle, as alleged in the indictment."
0 "We find the evidence sufficient to sustain the juryâ€™s verdict finding appellant guilty of murder with malice and assessing his punishment at 99 years in the penitentiary."
2 "On cross-examination a photograph of the nude body of the deceased was exhibited to appellant and he was asked concerning various bruises shown by such photograph."
5 "He testified in part:"
2 "In rebuttal the photograph and another similar one were identified by the officer who took them as a true representation of the scene; of the body lying on the bed and showing the bruises on the body as he viewed them through the naked eye."
2 "The photographs were admitted over the objection â€œthey donâ€™t add anything to the testimony which has already been testified to, they show the bruises and marks, they are inflammatory * * â€™."
2 "There is no dispute as to whether they were there or not, he just testified he didnâ€™t see them.â€"
4 "The rule relating to the introduction of photographs of the body of the deceased which may be inflammatory has been stated and applied in a number of rather recent decisions."
5 "R. 582, 223 S.W. 2d 625, we said: â€œWe think the condition evidenced by the photographs was useful to the jury in not only determining an intent to kill, but also the malice, if any was shown; and photographs have always been held admissable provided they serve to illustrate any necessary point in the cause.â€"
5 "R. 12, 266 S.W. 2d 124, we said: â€œRegardless of the previous holding of this Court upon the question, it appears that the instant case is controlled by the case of Gibson v State, 153 Tex. Cr."
5 "R. 582, 223 S.W. 2d 625, wherein it was held that pictures of the deceased were admissible upon the issue of malice and intent to kill."
6 "Each of these matters was an issue in this case."
1 "We are unable to conclude that the pictures were not admissible as shedding light upon those Issue.â€"
5 "State, supra, and said: â€œIf photographs serve to illustrate a disputed issue, it is immaterial that they are also inflammatoryâ€"
3 "Appellant cites a number of cases where pictures were found to be inflammatory and not admissible under the facts."
5 "Among these cases are Wooley v."
5 "State is not regarded as authority in this case, for"
5 "Judge Davidson wrote the opinion of the court reversing the Borroum case, actually upon the failure of the trial court to grant a special requested charge, and while Judge Morrison concurred in the reversal of that conviction, he did so because of the introduction into the evidence"
1 "We find no error in the admission of the photographs and we find no error in the record which calls for reversal."
5 "I remain convinced of the soundness of the very recent holding in Borroum v."
5 "State, supra, and respectfully dissent to the affirmance of this conviction because of the admission into evidence of photographs of the nude and bloody body of the deceased taken at the scene which shed no light upon any issue in the case."
2 "Is that how she appeared there that day?"
2 "I donâ€™t recall just exactly how she looked, to be exact."
2 "But you said you didnâ€™t see those bruises that are there in that picture ?"
2 "I saw the one on her shoulder and the one on her cheek."
2 "You canâ€™t display that to the jury; how about the bruises in that picture, do you remember seeing those bruises like that when you put her on the bed or when the police came?"
2 "She wasnâ€™t bruised like that."
2 "This is an appeal from an order entered in a habeas corpus proceeding remanding appellant to custody for extradition to the State of Louisiana."
2 "At the hearing, the state introduced into evidence the executive warrant of the governor of this state and also the requisition of the governor of Louisiana."
2 "The governorâ€™s executive warrant recites that it has been made known to him by the governor of the State of Louisiana that appellant â€œhaving been tried, convicted and sentenced for the crime of criminal neglect of family, has violated his probation committed in said State and that said defendant has taken refuge in the State of Texas * * * .â€"
2 "Appellant also introduced into evidence certain duly authenticated papers accompanying the requisition."
2 "From the papers it appears that appellant was convicted on September 1, 1959, in the State of Louisiana for the misdemeanor crime of criminal neglect of family and sentenced to serve one year in jail."
2 "The sentence was suspended by the court and appellant placed upon probation for a period of one year upon certain terms and conditions."
2 "Trial was had and notice of appeal given on October 20, 1959."
2 "On March 23, 1960, warrant was issued for appellantâ€™s arrest, by the Judge of the Juvenile Court, R. Nolan Moosa, in and for St. Landry Parish, upon affidavit being made that appellant had violated the conditions of his probation."
2 "On August 22, 1960, affidavit was made by the commissioner of public welfare of the State of Louisiana in lieu of warrant as prescribed by law, stating that appellant had violated the conditions of his probation and commanding that he be arrested and held as a fugitive from the state, pending extradition and return to the jurisdiction."
5 "In the recent case of Ex parte Knoll, 339 S.W. 2d 678, citing Ex parte Higgins, 338 S.W. 2d 717, in upholding the action of the governor of this state ordering the return of a relator to the demanding state after revocation of his probation in that state this court said:"
2 "The requisition of the governor of the State of Louisiana in the instant case is accompanied by a copy of the judgment rendered against appellant and reciting that appellant has violated his probation."
0 "Such requisition is sufficient to authorize the issuance of the executive warrant by the governor of this state."
5 "â€œ â€˜Under the provisions of Section 3 o f Article 1008a, Vernonâ€™s Ann."
5 "C.C.P., the Governor of this State is authorized to recognize a requisition and issue his executive warrant of extradition when the demand is accompanied â€œby a copy of a judgment of conviction or of a sentence imposed in execution thereof, together with a statement by the Executive Authority of the demanding State that the person claimed has escaped from confinement or has broken the terms of his bail, probation or parole.â€"
3 "The offense is driving while intoxicated; the punishment, 5 days in jail and a fine of $150."
2 "The evidence shows that an automobile traveling at a high rate of speed (one witness testified â€œdoing a good 90 miles an hourâ€) struck the rear of a pickup truck which was pushing an automobile in an effort to get the motor started."
2 "There was but one occupant of the speeding car."
2 "Darden Sr. went to the scene after calling one Noguess."
2 "He testified that he saw appellant there."
2 "â€œI started looking for the ones that were hurt for the ambulance to pick up and I run by the pickup and passed the car setting Mr. Widnerâ€™s drive, and I saw him coming back.â€"
2 "Mr. Darden further testified that appellant said: â€œThem people ought not to have been in the highway stopped,â€ and he said â€œThey wasnâ€™t stopped, you was lowering the boom on them that appellant asked him to make a statement that the people were stopped."
2 "â€œI asked him if he was driving the other automobile and he said â€˜Thatâ€™s right, and I went and made an apology for that wreck.â€™ â€"
2 "The witness Darden also testified that the driver was the only person in the speeding car; that he could not â€œstraight out come out and identify him as he went bythat appellant told him he was driving and he had some blood on his arm and forehead."
2 "Charles Regusa, who owned the pickup truck and also owned and was driving the car being pushed, testified that while he was looking for his neighbor Morgan Ness, the driver of the truck, and was asking for him, the appellant â€œwalked up to me and said, T was driving the car.â€™ and I said â€˜Are you hurt?â€™ and he said, â€˜No.â€™ â€"
1 "We overrule the contention that the evidence is insufficient to sustain a finding by the jury that the appellant drove an automobile on a public highway at the time in question, and point out that the appellantâ€™s statement that he was the driver of the automobile involved in the collision was a res gestae statement as well as a statement in the nature of an oral confession."
1 "We also overrule the contention that the trial court erred in failing to charge on circumstantial evidence by reason of the proof that he was the driver."
0 "There was sufficient evidence also to sustain the juryâ€™s finding that appellant was intoxicated."
2 "Darden Sr. testified â€œI saw he was staggering â€” he was pretty tight.â€"
2 "Darden Jr. testified: â€œI could tell he was drunk â€” by the way he was staggeringâ€ but did not get close enough to smell his breath."
2 "City Marshal Cox of Pinehurst, who investigated the accident, testified that he smelled intoxicants on appellantâ€™s breath and observed him walk: â€œI didnâ€™t know when I first saw him whether he might have been intoxicated or injuredâ€; that he asked appellant if he was injured and he said he wasnâ€™t; that he had observed people under the influence of intoxicating liquor on many occasions and from his observation of appellant on the occasion in question: â€œWell, I certainly thought he was intoxicated or I wouldnâ€™t have charged him with D.W.I.â€"
2 "It was brought out on cross-examination that Officer Cox offered to give appellant a urine test, but he refused it."
2 "Sheriff Holts, who saw appellant after his arrest testified that he smelled â€œsome kind of strong alcohol on his breath--I was talking to the man and I had to run out of the way to keep him from urping on me in the officeâ€; that â€œhe was to far gone, he was far from being on the border line."
2 "The man was drunk while he was in that office.â€"
3 "Appellantâ€™s remaining contention is that there was no evidence that the offense charged was committed in Texas."
2 "While the state was not mentioned, the evidence shows that the collision occurred on the outskirts of Orange on Highway 90, in Orange County, Highway 90 being â€œa public highway open to the public to travel to and from Beaumont.â€"
2 "No issue was raised in the trial court before verdict concerning proof of venue."
5 "If, however, appellant is in position to complain that the venue was not proved because it was not shown that the place in question was in Texas, we find the evidence"
3 "The offense is driving while intoxicated; the punishment, 3 days in jail and a fine of $50."
2 "The transcript was filed in this court a year later."
2 "A statement of facts approved by the trial judge was filed in the trial court on January 17, 1961, and in this court the next day."
5 "4, V.A.C.C.P., provides that the defendant shall file the statement of facts in duplicate with the clerk of the trial court within 90 days after the date of giving notice of appeal."
5 "As amended in 1959, said section further provides that the judge trying the cause may extend such time â€œand the approval of the statement of facts"
2 "There is nothing in this record to explain or excuse the delay in filing the statement of facts in the trial court or the forwarding of the transcript to this court."
5 "The courtâ€™s approval of the statement of facts certified to by the court reporter on October 29, 1959, bears no date, hence is not within the statute mentioned relating to the approval of the statement of facts"
0 "The statement of facts, not having been filed within the time provided by the statute, may not be considered."
0 "The proceedings appear to be otherwise regular and we find no error."
2 "This is an appeal from an order entered in the county court dismissing an appeal to that court from a conviction in the corporation court of the city of Henrietta, because of certain defects in the appeal bond."
2 "Such an appeal is authorized."
3 "Murder is the offense; the punishment, ninety-nine years in the penitentiary."
2 "The evidence is undisputed that on February 20,1960, in Harris County, the appellant shot and killed the deceased, Leona Pearl Sawyer, with whom he had been living for approximately three years."
3 "The only major conflict in the evidence concerns whether the killing was the result of an accident or whether it was a malicious murder."
2 "Witnesses appearing for the state testified to facts which would authorize the jury to determine that the killing was murder with malice aforethought."
2 "Testifying in his own behalf, the appellant claimed the killing was accidental."
2 "Under a proper instruction from the court on murder with malice, murder without malice, and accident, the jury chose to accept the evidence as presented by the witnesses for the state, and rejected that of the appellant."
0 "The evidence is amply sufficient to support the juryâ€™s verdict, and no benefit would be derived from a summation of the evidence as given by each individual witness."
2 "The record contains no formal bills of exception nor objections to the courtâ€™s charge."
2 "The voluminous statement of facts, consisting of 531 pages, contains only one informal bill of exception."
2 "After the mother of the deceased had testified on direct examination and cross-examination, she was again questioned by the attorney for the state, Mr. Ernst, on re-direct examination, as follows:"
2 "Following this occurrence the attorney for the appellant moved for a mistrial, which motion the court overruled."
2 "The appellant then reserved his exception."
2 "Complaint was made by the appellant to the evidence elicited by the question and answer for the reason that the evidence showed that he had shot the deceased on a previous occasion."
0 "The evidence would appear to be admissible."
2 "As will be seen from the above, only a general objection was made."
3 "Subsequent to this ruling by the court and after the introduction of further testimony, appellantâ€™s counsel moved for a mistrial."
0 "We think the evidence, which appellant deemed â€œhighly prejudicial,â€ was made harmless to him (appellant) by the able trial judgeâ€™s instruction to the jury to disregard it and that any harm which might have resulted to the appellant was thereby cured."
5 "85 as follows:"
0 "While the asking of the leading question might well be improper, the response given to the question asked was not hearsay."
0 "But appellant made no objection after the question was answered, and there is no showing as to why he chose to delay making his objection."
5 "The contention made by appellant was properly determined by this court contrary to the appellant in the case of Bell v."
6 "I instruct the jury to disregard it."
5 "[The Court: â€œDisregard that testimony, gentlemen."
6 "â€œ â€˜There are numerous decisions holding that this court will judge of the action of the trial court in rejecting or admitting testimony from the standpoint of the objections made, and not from the standpoint of objections which might have been made but were not.â€™ â€"
2 "â€œThe asking of the question was improper impeachment of the defense witness and the court properly sustained the objection and excluded the answer."
0 "But appellant not having objected until the question was answered, his failure to declare a mistrial because of the question and answer will not authorize a reversal."
4 "One may not permit an objectionable question to be asked and speculate as to its answer before objection."
3 "Statutory rape is the offense; the punishment, twenty-five years in the penitentiary."
5 "The undisputed testimony is as follows:"
2 "Appellant, who was the godfather of the complaining witnessâ€™ sister, went to the witnessâ€™ home after midnight on the occasion in question and asked to see a girl who was staying there."
0 "We find the evidence sufficient to support the juryâ€™s verdict."
2 "The complaining witness was thirteen years old at the time of the trial but only twelve years of age at the time of the commission of the offense."
2 "She was told that her boy friend, Nick, was out in the car, too drunk to come in but that he was calling her."
2 "Accompanying appellant out to the car, she found Nick was not among the other boys there."
2 "Appellant told her to get in the car and they would take her to the place where he was supposed to be, drunk."
2 "The prosecutrix got in the car and was driven to a vacant apartment on Applegrove, where Nick supposedly was."
2 "The facts further reveal that in addition to the prosecutrix and the appellant, four other boys â€” Gerardo Ramirez Cantu, Daniel Ramerez, Florencio Garcia, and Johnny Hernandez â€” went inside."
2 "The prosecutrix was told to go upstairs, which she did."
2 "Not again seeing Nick, she started running downstairs but was pushed back."
2 "She stated that the boys â€œgrabbedâ€ her; that â€œthey were all around;â€ that Daniel Ramerez grabbed and pulled her to â€œthe room,â€ and that the boys started tearing her slacks and panties."
2 "These were the same boys, she stated, whom she had previously named as being with her on the steps and preventing her from going back downstairs, and that appellant was present."
2 "She later testified that she did not know which boys were there but that there were â€œaround three boys thereâ€ holding her hands and legs."
2 "The witness then testified that after she had been undressed from the waist down Ramerez first had intercourse with her and then the appellant had intercourse with her, as did, subsequently, the other boys."
5 "The record reveals that the appellant was present during the"
2 "By a formal bill of exception, appellant brings forward two contentions."
3 "First, he complains of and submits as error the action of the trial court in failing to instruct the jury relative to the application of the suspended sentence law."
2 "Appellant had duly filed his application for suspended sentence, with the affidavit in support thereof duly executed."
2 "After the state had adduced all its testimony and had rested its case, the defendant then offered in evidence as his exhibit No. 1 the application for a suspended sentence, which he had filed with the papers of the case."
2 "The application, with the affidavit, was admitted by the court â€œfor whatever its worth.â€"
2 "Appellant then rested his case."
2 "He cites numerous authorities, none of which are in point."
3 "Appellant contends that the offering in evidence of the application for the suspended sentence created a fact issue for the jury and that it made it incumbent upon the trial court to instruct upon and to present to the jury for its determination the issue of a suspended sentence."
0 "We do not agree with this contention."
2 "For all practical purposes, the application for the suspended sentence, with the affidavit, was already in the evidence, without being admitted."
4 "The suspended sentence statute, Art. 776, C.C.P., provides, in part, that in no case shall sentence be suspended except when the proof shall show that the defendant has never before been convicted of a felony in this state or in any other state."
6 "This is an essential element in the suspended sentence statute."
2 "The proof which appellant relies upon to comply with this provision of the statute is his application for suspended sentence already before the jury as a pleading."
5 "In the application appellant â€œrepresents to the Court * * * that he has never before been convicted of-a felony during his life, neither in this state nor in any other,â€ followed by his"
4 "We are cited to no authority holding that the defendantâ€™s sworn application for suspended sentence constitutes proof requiring the submission of the issue to the jury."
5 "652, 245 S.W. 2d 497, cited by appellant, the defendant testified at the trial that he had never been convicted of a felony, and was subject to cross-examination."
2 "Here, appellant did not testify, but offered his own application for suspended sentence."
2 "He did not make himself available for cross-examination."
2 "Barnett was less specific in his testimony but did say that he observed appellant having intercourse from the rear with Pelton."
4 "It has been the consistent holding of this court that a defendant can not take the witness stand for a limited purpose, and when he testifies he may be cross-examined on the whole case."
5 "R. 183, 177 S.W. 1161, the defendant pleaded guilty and took the witness stand to testify that he had never been convicted of a felony."
4 "This court held that the state could cross-examine him as to the mode and manner of committing the offense."
4 "It would do violence to the intent of the legislature and to the holdings mentioned to hold that the pleading of the defendant would suffice as proof that he had never been convicted of a felony, thereby relieving him of the necessity of testifying as a witness or of offering the evidence of other witnesses who could be cross-examined."
3 "In the same bill of exception, appellant raised another proposition or contention, maintaining that the trial court materially erred in charging the jury upon the law of principals."
3 "He first says that there was no evidence to support the charge and that it was a comment upon the weight of the evidence."
3 "He further contends that the issue of his guilt was submitted to the jury upon two separate factual theories; that the jury returned a general verdict of guilty; and that there was no way of ascertaining upon which one of the two theories the jury found him guilty."
0 "Appellantâ€™s contentions are without merit."
0 "We further think that the evidence is abundantly sufficient to support either theory of the state as to appellantâ€™s guilt, whether it be as a principal with his companions or as an individual offender."
1 "Appellantâ€™s contentions are overruled, and the judgment is affirmed."
2 "Appellant was tried in the County Court of Cochran County, before a special judge and a jury, upon complaint and information alleging that he committed an aggravated assault upon Raymond Kuykendall, a special deputy sheriff who was in the discharge of his official duties."
2 "Appellant sought to have the jury instructed to acquit if they found that Kuykendall was not a special deputy sheriff discharging his official duties, but the court submitted both aggravated assault and simple assault."
1 "The judgment rendered and entered recites that the following verdict was returned and entered: â€œWe, the jury, find the defendant Ed Workman guilty, and assess a fine of $25.00 and Court cost of $58.30.â€"
5 "Following this verdict, the judgment from which this appeal is prosecuted recites:"
0 "The judgment rendered in effect upheld appellantâ€™s contention that he was entitled to acquittal if not found guilty of aggravated assault."
0 "In any event, the judgment appearing in the transcript is not a judgment of conviction from which an appeal may be taken to this court."
1 "â€œIt is therefore considered, ordered, and adjudged by the court that the defendant, Ed Workman, be immediately discharged from all further liability upon the charge for which he has herein been tried and that he go hence without day.â€"
3 "The conviction is for negligent homicide in the first degree; the punishment, nine months in jail."
5 "The information alleged that the appelant, while lawfully"
2 "It is undisputed that the automobile appellant was driving east on the south side of an east-west expressway struck the south curb, then travelled to the left striking a traffic island six to eight inches high and from two and one-half to three feet wide, overturned and came to rest partly on the island and partly in the south lane of the two lanes on the north side; and that the automobile traveling west, in which the deceased was riding as a passenger, skidded thirty-nine feet before striking appellantâ€™s automobile resulting in the deceasedâ€™s death."
0 "The proof fails to correspond with and support the material allegations in the information."
0 "All the evidence, both for the state and the appellant, shows that the appellant did not, as alleged, drive his automobile into and against Gary Wilks thereby inflicting serious bodily injury restulting in his death."
0 "The failure of the proof introduced to support the material allegations in the information calls for a reversal."
3 "The sole contention presented on appeal is that the court erred in failing to charge on the law of circumstantial evidence."
6 "For this reason, the facts will have to be stated more fully than we would normally do."
2 "Detective Privett of the Lubbock police testified that on the day in question he was concealed, along with the parkâ€™s policeman Barnett, in a tool shed which opened into a latrine located in one of the city parks; that both he and Barnett were observing the inside of the latrine through holes in the door; that appellant came in and waited around a while without availing himself of the facilities of the latrine until a man, whom he later determined to be named Pelton, entered and very shortly thereafter lowered his trousers, pulled up his shirt, and bent over holding on to his ankles, and since he was not wearing underclothes this left his entire rectal area exposed."
2 "He stated that Pelton said to appellant, â€œBe sure and get it hard because itâ€™s no good ."
2 "unless it is hardthat appellant finally said â€œit was hard enoughâ€; that both men were facing away from him at the time and he saw appellantâ€™s hips move in and out but that Pelton remained still; and that appellant was immediately behind Pelton in a standing position â€œso close * * * that his stomach was up against the back of * * * Pelton.â€"
2 "He testified that after they had observed this conduct for a short time he and Barnett burst out into the latrine, at which time he saw appellantâ€™s sex organ in an upright position as he withdrew from â€œbodily contactâ€ with Pelton, that Peltonâ€™s rectum â€œwas red and looked like it was turned wrong side out,â€ and likened it to the rectum of a horse immediately after discharging waste matter."
2 "On cross-examination, he admitted that he did not see appellant's private penetrate Peltonâ€™s rectum, because they both had their backs to him, but he did testify to bodily contact between the parties, and that appellantâ€™s penis was â€œvery muchly erected.â€"
5 "His version of their conversation was that Pelton told appellant he would have to watch out as he was unable to see out from his"
2 "Appellant, testifying in his own behalf, stated that while on his way from home to work he drove through the park and stopped at the latrine to relieve himself; that the man, who he had never seen before but whom he later learned to be Pelton, came in and made the proposal that he have intercourse with him in the rectum; that he declined, saying that his penis was not hard; that a short while thereafter Pelton inquired of it was hard yet and dropped his pants, at which time the officers arrived."
2 "He denied that he touched Pelton or that his penis had been erect."
2 "He offered his wife and another reputation witness."
0 "We have stated the facts more fully than usual in order to demonstrate that penetration was proven by direct evidence and that the requested charge was not required under the facts."
0 "No reason exists why the rule should not apply to a sodomy case such as the one before us where the victim of the lust is a young boy, 13 years of age, when the acts are committed."
5 "R. 164r 261 S.W. 2d 836, relied upon by appellant is not here controlling because in that case the prior acts of sodomy were upon two boys who were not present when the offense of indecent exposure to another boy for which the accused was being tried was committed."
3 "Appellant next insists that the courtâ€™s charge was fundamentally erroneous because the abstract definition of the offense given by the court informed the jury that certain acts, not charged in the indictment, would constitute the offense."
2 "No objections were made by appellant to the charge nor were any requested charges presented to the court."
2 "The indictment charged that appellant committed oral sodomy upon the prosecuting witness."
4 "While the court defined the offense under that portion of Art. 524, V.A.C.C.P., which provides that â€œWhoever has carnal copulation * * * in an opening of the body, except sexual parts, with another human being, * * * shall be guilty of sodomy * * the court did make a direct and pertinent application of the law to the case as alleged in the indictment and made by the facts."
2 "Under the courtâ€™s instruction, the jury was requested, before convicting the appellant, to find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that he did have carnal copulation with the prosecuting witness by using his mouth on his sexual parts."
0 "Such instruction required a finding by the jury of the constituent elements of the offense of oral sodomy as charged in the indictment and the charge does not present fundamental error."
1 "We overrule appellantâ€™s remaining contention that the evidence is insufficient to show that the offense was committed within the period of limitation."
4 "The limitation period for the offense of sodomy is three years."
2 "The indictment was presented against the appellant on April 20, 1959."
5 "The testimony of the injured party that he first met the appellant â€œaround"
2 "Appellant was convicted of the offense of sodomy and his punishment assessed at confinement in the penitentiary for 15 years."
2 "After trial, sentence, and notice of appeal to this court, appellant was adjudged insane and committed to a state hospital."
2 "Upon motion of appellantâ€™s counsel, all further proceedings in this court were suspended and the cause was ordered retired from the docket until it should be properly shown that appellant had been restored to sanity."
2 "It is now shown by judgment duly entered in the Criminal District Court of Dallas County that appellant has been restored to sanity and, upon motion of the state, the cause is ordered reinstated upon the docket for further proceedings."
5 "The prosecuting witness, a young boy 15 years of age at the"
2 "Appellantâ€™s written confession was'introduced in evidence by the state in which he stated that he first met the prosecuting witness in December 1957 and that, in February or March 1958, he began having him come to his farm in Seagoville for week end visits."
2 "Appellant admitted in the confession that upon the occasion of several of the visits he fondled the private parts of the prosecuting witness and on one occasion committed an act of sodomy upon him."
2 "Appellant did not testify but called his brother as a witness who testified that appellant had been under the treatment of a psychiatrist."
3 "Appellant insists that the court erred in permitting the state to introduce, as original evidence, proof that he had committed the extraneous offense of fondling upon the prosecuting witness in Lufkin prior to March 1958, when the alleged act of sodomy occurred."
5 "R. 503, 236 S.W. 2d 820, this court held that, in cases involving incest and rape under the age of consent, acts other than the one charged in the indictment were admissible as evidencing the probability of the charged act and the unnaturalness of the accusedâ€™s attitude toward the victim of his lust."
5 "The Johns case was followed in Gephart v."
2 "The appeal is from a conviction for violation of an ordinance of the city of Marshall."
2 "The prosecution arose in the corporation court where appellant was found guilty and assessed a $200 fine."
2 "He appealed to the county court and the trial resulted in a like fine being assessed by the jury."
4 "The ordinance provides: â€œIt shall be unlawful for any peddler, salesman, solicitor, or any other person who goes on the premises of another person, to remain on such premises after he has been ordered by any lawful occupant to leave such premises.â€"
4 "The punishment for violation of said ordinance is found in the following section of the Code of Ordinances of the city of Marshall: â€œIt shall be unlawful for any person to violate or fail to comply with any provision of this code, and where no specific penalty is provided therefor, the violation of any provision of this code shall be a fine not exceeding two hundred dollars; provided, where such fine is for an offense for which the state law"
2 "Appellant filed various exceptions and motions to quash the complaint which were overruled."
3 "On appeal he attacks the ordinance as unconstitutional for several reasons; and attacks the complaint, both because of the invalidity of the ordinance and the insufficiency of said complaint to charge a violation thereof."
4 "A state statute, Art. 479 P.C., provides: â€œAny peddler or hawker of goods or merchandise who enters upon premises owned or leased by another and wilfully refuses to leave said premises after having been notified by the owner or possessor of said premises or his agent, to leave the same, shall be fined not less than one nor more than twenty-five dollars.â€"
2 "You are not saying that you didnâ€™t do wrong, you are just saying that you didnâ€™t get caught?"
2 "The first count charged negligent homicide in the first degree."
4 "Under this statute, as well as under the ordinance in question, the maximum punishment which may be meted out to a peddler who enters the premises of another and refuses to leave, after being notified or ordered to do so by one in lawful occupancy of said premises, is a fine of $25.00; whereas the ordinance provides that â€œany other personâ€ (one who is not a peddler, salesman or solicitor) may be fined $200.00 for the same act and failure."
4 "Article 1, Section 3 of the Constitution of Texas and the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States secure to all persons similarly circumstanced equal protection under the laws of this state or any subdivision thereof, and it is a well settled rule in all jurisdictions that a penal ordinance of municipal corporation constitutes state action subject to these fundamental provisions of the state and federal constitutions."
4 "As these provisions have been construed by the highest courts of this state as well as by the Supreme Court of the United States, a state law is not repugnant to either constitutional provision so long as unequal treatment of persons is based upon a reasonable and substantial classification of persons."
4 "Unequal treatment of persons under a state law which is founded upon unreasonable and unsubstantial classification constitutes discriminatory state action and violates both the state and federal constitutions."
5 "Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U.S. 27, 5 S. Ct. 357, 28 L. Ed. 923; Williams v. Arkansas, 217 U.S. 79, 30 S. Ct. 493, 54 L. Ed. 673; Baccus v. Louisiana, 232 U.S. 334, 34 S. Ct. 439, 58 L.

Ed. 1233; Stans"
0 "There appears no reasonable and substantial classification of persons which justifies the imposition of a $25.00 fine upon peddlers, salesmen, and solicitors and a $200 fine upon all other persons for the same act."
1 "For the reasons stated, the ordinance is void and the conviction thereunder cannot be sustained."
1 "The judgment is reversed and the prosecution is ordered dismissed."
3 "The offense is burglary, with two prior convictions for felonies less than capital alleged for enhancement; the punishment, life imprisonment under Art. 63, V.A.C.C.P."
2 "The stateâ€™s evidence shows that the prosecuting witness, Dennis Osborn, lived with his family at 5913 Stones Throw in the City of Houston."
2 "Appellant worked for him in his construction business."
2 "Osborn testified that, on the date alleged, when he returned home with his family from a Colorado vacation and drove into the driveway, he saw appellantâ€™s automobile backed up to the garage with the trunk lid open and appellant standing inside the garage; that when appellant saw him he ducked through a door into the back yard; that he proceeded to appellantâ€™s automobile and observed three guns in the open trunk, being two rifles and a shot gun, which he identified as his guns that he had left locked in a gun case in his home."
2 "The witness testified that he then proceeded inside the house and found that a gun case in the den had been broken open and â€œthere were marks on the wood where it had been pried open with some object.â€"
2 "He testified that he then discovered that the door of the house between the patio and back yard had been pried open and â€œthere were scratches where it had been pried open.â€"
2 "The witness testified that appellant then reappeared on the scene with another of his guns which also was missing and stated that he found it in the back yard; that appellant stated he did not know how the guns got in his automobile and that he had been out hunting for the witnessâ€™ dog."
2 "The witness further testified that he did not give the appellant permission to break and enter his house and take any property therefrom."
5 "It was shown by the testimony of Officer H. L. Sherrouse, who went to the scene and investigated the burglary, that a screw"
2 "In proof of the two prior convictions, the state offered in evidence certain official court records and certain authenticated records of the Texas Prison System."
4 "Included in the prison records were certified copies of the indictment, judgment, and sentence in Cause No. 61808, Styled The State of Texas v. Marion Todd, on the docket of Criminal District Court No. 2 of Harris County which showed that on October 17, 1949, the defendant therein was convicted in said court of the offense of burglary and certified copies of the indictment, judgment, and sentence in Cause No. 70168, styled The State of Texas v. Marion Earl Todd, on the docket of Criminal District Court No. 3 of Harris County which showed that on November 3, 1953, the defendant therein was convicted in said court of the offense of felony theft."
2 "Also included in the prison records were fingerprints of the convict named therein, Marion Earl Todd, No. 127645."
2 "They testified that the screen door to the hallway was held closed by a spring and, further, that some time thereafter they identified appellant in a police lineup."
2 "Officer Jim Ballew of the Identification Division of the Harris County Sheriffâ€™s Office, upon being called as a witness by the state, testified that he had taken a set of fingerprints from the appellant which he had compared with the fingerprints contained in the prison records and expressed his expert opinion that they were of the same person."
2 "Proof was made that the two prior convictions were final convictions and that the offense for which appellant was convicted in 1953 was committed after appellantâ€™s first conviction in 1949 had become final."
1 "We first overrule appellantâ€™s contention that the court erred in permitting the state to prove the two prior alleged convictions by offering in evidence the authenticated prison records and the expert opinion evidence of Officer Ballew as to his comparison of fingerprints."
6 "Such method of proving prior convictions has been approved by this Court."
5 "The fact the judgments in the two prior convictions recited both that appellant â€œwaived a juryâ€ and was adjudged guilty â€œas"
3 "The conviction is for negligent homicide in the second degree; the punishment, one year in jail."
0 "We find no reversible error in the courtâ€™s refusal to grant a mistrial after Officer Lambert, while testifying with reference to the date of the commission of the offense for which appellant was convicted in 1953, volunteered the statement â€œall of his burglaries dated back about six months.â€"
2 "The court instructed the jury not to consider the statement."
0 "The courtâ€™s instruction was sufficient to cure any error therein."
3 "Appellantâ€™s remaining contention is that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction."
2 "The evidence shows a burglary of the house in question by someone."
0 "The proof of appellantâ€™s possession of the property recently stolen from the house, under the facts and circumstances shown, is sufficient to support the juryâ€™s verdict finding him guilty."
2 "The evidence, from the standpoint of the state, shows that appellant and one Robert Lopez went to a Lone Star Ice Station, produced pistols and had Wyman Jones, the night manager, open the cash register and put all of the cash and checks, except the pennies, in a paper bag."
2 "Mr. Jones and 16 year old Harley Wingo, another employee, were ordered to lie down with their faces to the floor and remain there under threat of being shot."
2 "The money and robbers were gone when they looked up."
2 "Officers answering a report of the robbery were given a description of the robbers, and appellant and Lopez were found four or five blocks away, sitting on the curb with the sack of money between them."
2 "They were taken back to the scene of the robbery where they were positively identified by Wyman Jones and Harley Wingo, who identified them later in the night at the police station, and again positively identified them at the trial."
2 "Appellant testified that he took no part in the robbery; did not know Robert Lopez until he saw the officers take two pistols from him and find a sack of money."
2 "He denied that he was sitting by Lopez or near the sack of money when the officers arrived."
2 "According to appellant, Mr. Jones and Harley Wingo were mistaken in their identification of him, and the officerâ€™s testimony as to his sitting on the curb with Robert Lopez, with the sack of money between them, was not true."
2 "The jury accepted the stateâ€™s version of the facts and the evidence sustains its verdict."
3 "It is contended that the arrest of appellant was unlawful and the evidence relating thereto and to the recovery of the fruits of the robbery was improperly admitted."
1 "We overrule this contention."
0 "Officer Tackitt testified without objection to these facts, hence appellant is in no position to rely upon his objection to Officer Donahoeâ€™s testimony to the same facts."
0 "We are unable to agree with appellantâ€™s contention that he has been deprived of a fair trial or of due process of law."
3 "The offense is burglary, with two prior felony convictions alleged for enhancement; the punishment, life."
2 "The witness Hereford testified that for some time prior to the date charged in the indictment he had left an air conditioning unit stored in the hallway of an apartment house under his control ; that on the day in question he received a call, went to the apartment house and found the unit sitting on the front porch some forty feet from where it had been stored."
2 "He testified further that in order to gain access to the hallway in question it was necessary to open a screen door, which would have required some force, and that he gave no one permission to enter and move the unit."
2 "He stated that when he placed the unit in the hallway it required the help of another man to lift it."
2 "Burnett and his wife testified that they were seated at their dining table in the apartment house in question on the day charged in the indictment and observed a 1952 De Soto automobile drive into the parking area at the rear of the building; that they observed it closely because Burnettâ€™s brother had an automobile of the same year and make; that two men, one of whom was appellant, got out of the automobile and walked toward the front of the apartment house."
2 "They testified that shortly thereafter they heard a loud niose, â€œsounded like a heavy object had been dropped,â€ and went to investigate."
2 "Burnett testified that he saw the air conditioning unit, which had been sitting in the hallway for some time, at the edge of the porch and appellantâ€™s companion â€œleaving the porch in a big lunge,â€ saw him run to the De Soto where appellant was seated at the wheel; it was driven away â€œin a big hurry,â€ and that he took down the license number and called Hereford."
6 "The prior convictions were established."
2 "Appellant did not testify in his own behalf and offered only the evidence that he had been incarcerated since his arrest."
3 "The offense is assault with intent to murder with malice; the punishment, 5 years."
2 "All of the evidence shows that, while some 12 to 15 feet from Frank H. Fryer, appellant fired a shot from a shotgun striking Fryer in the muscle of the right arm."
2 "As a result Fryer remained in the hospital for two months and sustained permanent injury."
2 "The evidence from the standpoint of the state shows that Frank H. Fryer was not armed and made no attack upon appellant."
5 "The appellant testified that he went with Fryerâ€™s wife, but that her husband â€œnever one single time ever caught us out any place or any drive-in movie and any - - or any act of doing wrong * * *"
2 "The husband appears to have had a strong suspicion about the matter, for Mary Louise had sued for divorce and testified that she was living in the house with her husband but not as man and wife on the day of the difficulty."
5 "The injured party, Frank H. Fryer, left his wife in their home about 7:20 P.M. on the day in question, driving his automo"
2 "The evidence is conflicting as to what was said and what appellant heard over the telephone, except that Mrs. Fryer said â€œFrank, donâ€™t kill me.â€"
2 "Frank H. Fryer, the husband and injured party, testified: â€œI frightened her because she thought I was goneâ€ and that after she made the statement â€œFrank, donâ€™t kill meâ€ he said: â€œIâ€™m not going to kill you."
2 "Mary Louise Fryer, who was divorced from the injured party at the time of the trial, testified that Fryer came in while she was talking to the appellant, struck her, knocked her off the sofa and knocked the telephone out of her hand and said â€œI ought to kill you.â€"
2 "The appellant testified that while he was talking to Mrs. Fryer, â€œThatâ€™s the time I heard her scream for her life."
2 "Did Louise Fryer say anything?"
2 "Appellant testified that he was some two miles away when he heard the statement of Mrs. Fryer, after which he â€œheard rumbling in the house and I heard voices and I couldnâ€™t very well make out what they were.â€"
2 "â€œAt that particular moment, I said on the telephone which I knew she could not have heard, I said â€˜Wait, and run into the street, until I get there, and Iâ€™ll pick you up and carry you to the police station and have an indictment returned against him (her husband) â€™ that he was afraid for her life; that when he got there, Fryer and his wife were in the middle of the street, and Fryer was hitting her â€œin the temple of the mole of her headâ€ with a pistol; that he said â€œFool, you had better shove him and run, because heâ€™s going to blow your brains outâ€; that Fryer didnâ€™t say a word; Mrs. Fryer was â€œcoming in my general directionâ€ when he shot - â€œI shot him when he leveled down * * * the pistol * * * I was still in the car.â€"
2 "He also testified that he fired a third shot which was also accidental."
0 "We find no error in the admission of evidence to the effect that the injured party had an incapacity in his left arm, and that appellantâ€™s physical condition was good."
0 "If under the facts such testimony was not admissible as bearing upon the issue of self defense, appellant is in no position to complain because like evidence was offered without objection."
0 "Remarks of counsel for the state during the introduction of evidence complained of should not have been made, but in view of the evidence are not deemed of such prejudicial nature as to warrant reversal."
3 "The conviction is for negligent homicide in the second degree; the punishment, two years in jail."
2 "No statement of facts adduced on the trial accompanies the record."
2 "The offense is charged by) indictment returned and presented by the grand jury of Dallas County, Texas, into the Criminal District Court of Dallas County."
2 "The trial was had and the judgment entered August 4, 1960, in the County Criminal Court No. 3 of Dallas County."
2 "By motion in writing filed August 5, 1960, the appellant challenged the jurisdiction of County Criminal Court No. 3 to try this cause on the ground that the order of transfer shows that it was transferred to the County Criminal Court of Dallas County."
2 "The motion was heard, considered and overruled."
5 "The judgment shows that on August 4, 1960, the stateâ€™s attorney and the appellant in person and by his attorney appeared"
0 "The complaint of any irregularity in the order of transfer of an indictment from the district court to a court having jurisdiction should be urged before announcing ready, entering a plea and standing trial."
1 "Nothing further being presented for review, the judgment is affirmed."
1 "Opinion approved by the Court"
3 "The conviction is for felony theft by bailee; the punishment, two years."
2 "On January 14, 1960, the appellant signed a rental contract with Hertz Rent-A-Car in El Paso for the use of a thunderbird automobile of the value of more than $5,000 to be there returned January 16, and it was then and there delivered to him."
2 "There were no restrictions, oral or written, covering the area of its use."
2 "Appellant said he lived in Fort Worth, and gave the number of a certain street as his address which appears on the rental agreement."
2 "Without giving any notice, the appellant did not return the car on January 16, and January 18 manager Edens of Hertz began a search for the car only to learn that appellant had been seen in Fort Worth, and on January 20 he filed a complaint in El Paso charging appellant with the theft of the car."
2 "On January 24, when the appellant refused to stop the car when signaled to do so by the police in Fort Worth, and ran a road block, they shot at and were pursuing him in the car at more than 100 miles per hour when he wrecked it."
2 "In his own behalf, the appellant testified that he used a credit card to rent the car from Hertz in El Paso on Thursday, January 14 to be returned according to the written rental agreement on January 16, and told the attendant he was going to Fort Worth where he lived and would need it for the week end and asked about week end rates, but was told that since it was Thursday the week end rates were not then effective and he went ahead and rented it; that he arrived in Fort Worth on January 16 and kept the car without notifying anyone."
6 "In view of our disposition of the case, a recitation of the facts is unnecessary."
2 "He further testified that he had previously rented a car from Hertz in Houston and drove it to Fort Worth and when the contract time for use of the car expired he went to the Hertz agency in Fort Worth and was informed that is was not necessary to get an extension and for that reason he did not believe it was necessary in this instance; that he was using the car while looking for employment, and at no time did he intend to convert the car to his own use but intended to return it."
2 "On January 24, he said his sister informed him by telephone that Hertz wanted the car returned and he was going that day to the Hertz agency in Fort Worth to arrange for the further use of the car until he found employment."
5 "But before he"
3 "Appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to show a conversion of the automobile because he never at any time asserted claim to it which was adverse to the owner."
3 "And further contends that if he did convert said automobile the evidence fails to show that it occurred in El Paso County."
2 "The evidence shows that the appellant presented to Hertz a valid credit card when he obtained the car which guaranteed payment up to $500, and that all rental and other charges from January 14, including January 24, were paid to Hertz by the guarantor."
2 "Appellant urges that this shows that he held the car at all times subject to and not adversely to Hertz."
2 "The evidence further shows that after leaving El Paso appellant stopped for gas in Van Horn, tendered a check which was refused, and then left the automobileâ€™s new spare tire with the service station attendant when the attendant started to syphon the gasoline out of the tank."
2 "He arrived in Fort Worth on January 16 but could not be located at the Fort Worth address he gave in El Paso, nor did his relatives at said address know of his whereabouts."
5 "When first approached by the officers in Fort Worth he fled at more than 100 m.p.h."
5 "and after being shot at five times while running a road block he wrecked the automobile and was apprehended."
0 "The facts and circumstances are sufficient to warrant the juryâ€™s conclusion that the appellant fradulently converted the car to his own use with the intent to deprive the owner of the value thereof in El Paso County."
3 "Appellant contends that a fatal variance exists between the proof and the allegation in the indictment that Fred C. Edens was the owner of the automobile."
2 "The evidence shows that Fred C. Edens was city manager for Hertz Rent-A-Car agency in El Paso."

5 "that he had control and possession of the automobile when it was rented by the appellant and that he was in charge of the rental agreements."
5 "Katherine Bibo testified that she was â€œRent-A-Car agent with Hertz Agencyâ€ at"
1 "It is concluded that the proof supports the allegation of ownership in Fred C. Edens, that ownership of the automobile was properly alleged in him and that there is no variance as the appellant contends."
0 "It is insisted that this conviction cannot stand because it rests on a bailment made when the appellant was under 21 years of age."

0 "If the appellant converted the car, he was guilty of theft by bailee, as charged."
0 "If he became a thief, then the bailment ceased, and Hertz was entitled to no rent money on the car."
5 "Certainly, the evidence does not reflect that the Dinerâ€™s Club"
0 "A thief would not be a bailee, and he would owe no rent."
0 "One cannot be both a bailee and a thief at the same time."
0 "He either remains a bailee or he becomes a thief."
0 "Had the Dinerâ€™s Club only paid Hertz for six daysâ€™ rentalâ€” that is, up until the time (January 20) that Hertz filed the complaint â€” then a different question would be presented."

2 "Appellant pleaded guilty to the unlawful possession of marihuana and, a jury being waived, the court assessed his punishment at 5 years in the penitentiary."

2 "Appellant filed certain objections and exceptions to the indictment which were, by the court, overruled."
3 "Appellant contends that the court erred in overruling his exception to the second count of the indictment on the ground it did not allege the offense of negligent homicide in the second degree."
6 "With such contention we agree."

4 "There is no statute in this state making such an act, per se, a penal offense."

6 "The first is without merit."
2 "The trial court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the testimony complained of."
3 "The second objection was made to the introduction of the knife into the evidence."
5 "The statement of facts reflects that prior to the making of the objection counsel for appellant had earlier allowed the knife to be introduced in evidence, stating at the time:"
3 "The offense is driving an automobile upon a public highway while intoxicated; the punishment, 3 days in jail and a fine of $100."

1 "Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the cause is."
4 "â€œRecognizances and bail bonds are forfeited in the following manner: The * * * judgment [nisi] * * * shall state that the same will be made final, unless good cause be shown at the next term of the court why the defendant did not appear.â€"

6 "This is a writ of error to review the final judgment in a bond forfeiture."

2 "While in flight, the man carrying the box dropped it on the ground."
2 "The box, when recovered by the officers, was found to be a case of Thunderbird Wine which the prosecuting witness identified by certain serial numbers thereon as the case of wine missing from his store."

5 "State, 25 Tex. App. 614, 8 S.W. 925, this court, in passing upon the trial courtâ€™s failure to instruct the jury as to the purpose for which certain testimony was admitted in the cause, said:"
0 "Under the record, we are unable to say that appellant was injured by the courtâ€™s failure to limit the juryâ€™s consideration of the impeachment testimony and overrule the contention that such omission in the charge constituted fundamental error requiring a reversal of the conviction."
2 "Appellant complains of the overruling of his objection to certain questions propounded to him on cross-examination by Stateâ€™s counsel in which he was asked, in substance, if he was telling the jury that Officer Gilbert was lying and not telling the truth when he testified that appellant had the bottle of whiskey in his pocket."
2 "Appellantâ€™s answer to the inquiry was in the affirmative."
1 "While the questions were argumentative and appellantâ€™s objection should have been sustained, under the record, the courtâ€™s ruling does not call for a reversal of the conviction."
2 "The issue of appellantâ€™s guilt was submitted to the jury upon a charge on the law of principals and circumstantial evidence."
2 "â€œBut it has never been held that such an omission in the charge is fundamental error which is necessarily fatal to the conviction."
4 "When such error is for the first time called to the attention of the trial court in a motion for a new trial, this court will not reverse because of it, unless it appears, from the whole evidence adduced on the trial, that the defendantâ€™s rights may have been injured in consequence of it.â€"
